# CHAPTER 10 Uncovering the Human Body
# 第10章 揭开人体的奥秘

If you want to really understand how something is made, it is often a good idea to take it apart, piece by piece. With some things, like watches and cars, it helps if you also know how to put them back together again. If what you want to understand is a human or an animal body, it has to be dead before you start, but the goal is the same.

如果真的想理解物体的组成，通常较好的办法是一块一块拆开它。对于一些物体来说，如果知道怎么装回去，就更有助于理解。如果你想理解的是人体或动物体，在开始拆开之前必须是死得，但目标是一样的。

Galen, as we know, dissected - took apart - many animals, because he couldn't dissect any humans. He assumed that the anatomy of pigs or monkeys was pretty much like that of human beings, and in some ways he was right, but there are differences, too. The dissection of human bodies started to be done occasionally around 1300, when medical schools began to teach anatomy. At first, when people noticed any differences between what they saw in the human body and what Galen had said, they assumed that human beings had simply changed, not that Galen had been wrong! But as they began to look more closely, anatomists discovered more and more small differences. It became obvious that there was more to uncover about the human body.

就像我们知道的一样，盖伦解剖过很多动物，因为他不能解剖人。他假设对猪或猴子的解剖应该和对人类差不多，以某种方式来说他是正确的，但也还是有区别的。人体解剖以很偶然的方式开始于大约1300年，在医学院开始教授解剖学的时候。开始的时候，人们注意到人体与盖伦描述的有不同之处，他们假设人类只是改变了，盖伦说的并没有错！但当他们更靠近仔细看时，解剖学家发现了越来越多的细节区别。很显然，有更多人体的秘密等待人们去发现。

The man who did the uncovering was an anatomist and surgeon known to us as Andreas Vesalius (1514-64). His full name was Andreas Wytinck van Wesel. He was born in Brussels, in modern-day Belgium, where his father was a medical man employed by the German Emperor Charles V. A clever child, he was sent to the University of Louvain to study arts subjects, but decided to change to medicine. Clearly ambitious, he then went to Paris where some of the best teachers were. They all followed Galen, and during his three years there he impressed them. He also showed his abilities in Greek and Latin, and his fascination with dissection. A war between the German Empire and France forced him to leave Paris, but he reintroduced human dissection to the medical faculty at Louvain before traveling, in 1537, to what at the time was the best medical school in the world, at the University of Padua in Italy. He took his exams, passed with the highest distinction, and the next day was appointed as a lecturer in surgery and anatomy. At Padua they knew when they were on to a good thing: Vesalius taught anatomy through his own dissections, the students loved him, and the very next year he published a series of beautiful anatomical illustrations of parts of the human body. They were so good that doctors all over Europe began copying these pictures for their own use, much to Vesalius's annoyance, since they were actually stealing his work.

揭秘的人是解剖学家和外科医生Andreas Vesalius(1514-64)，他的全名是Andreas Wytinck van Wesel，他生于今天比利时的布鲁塞尔，他父亲是德国皇帝查理五世的御用医生。由于从小聪明，他被送到Louvain大学学习艺术，但后来改为学习医学。他表现出了明显的志向，所以被送到了巴黎，那里有最好的老师。他们都追随盖伦的思想，在那里度过了三年，他给他们留下了深刻的印象。他表现了在拉丁文和希腊文方面的才能，以及在解剖方面的极大兴趣。德国和法国之间的战争使他离开了巴黎，但在1537年他重新向Louvain大学的医学系介绍了人体解剖，然后就旅行到了意大利的Padua大学，那里有当时世界上最好的医学学校。他参加了考试，以最高分通过了考试，第二天就被任命为外科及解剖学讲师。在Padua他们在进行一件美好的事：Vesalius通过自己解剖来讲授解剖学，学生们都很热爱他，第二年他就发表了一系列优美的人体各部分解剖学插图。插图太好了，整个欧洲开始复制这些图片进行使用，这非常令Vesalius烦恼，因为他们开始剽窃他的工作成果。

Cutting open a dead body is not a particularly pleasant thing to do. After death, the body quickly begins to decay and smell and, in Vesalius's time, there was no way to stop it from rotting. This meant that the dissection had to be done quickly, and in an order that made it possible to get it done before the smells became over-powering. The belly was done first, since the intestines are the first to rot. This was followed by the head and brain, then the heart, lungs, and other organs in the chest cavity. The arms and legs were saved to the end: they lasted the best. The whole thing had to be done in two or three days, and anatomy was generally taught in winter, when the colder weather at least delayed the decay and gave the doctors a little more time.

切开一具死尸并不是什么很愉快的事。在人死后，尸体很快就开始腐烂、发臭，在Vesalius的时代，没有方法能防止腐烂。这意味着解剖必须很快进行，在臭不可闻之前必须要按一定顺序解剖完毕。胃部必须首先解剖，因为肠子会首先腐烂；然后是头部和脑子，然后是心脏、肺部，以及胸腔内的其他内脏器官；胳膊、腿可以放到最后，它们持续的时间最长。整个解剖过程必须在两到三天内完成，解剖学通常在冬天教授，因为天气寒冷，尸体腐烂的没那么快，可以给医生解剖更多的时间。

Means of preserving bodies were discovered in the 1700s, and this made it easier to take more time to dissect and examine the whole body. When I was a medical student, I took eight months to dissect a body, and on dissection days my clothes and fingernails smelled not of the rotting body but of the preserving chemical. I worked on the body of an old man and I became very familiar with him during those months. The order we did things was pretty much the same as it was in Vesalius's time, except we saved the brain for last, since it is such a complicated organ and we were supposed to be better at carefully cutting out and exposing the different parts of the body by then. The old man had donated his body to science. He certainly taught me a lot.

保存尸体的方法是在18世纪开始时发现的，这使慢慢解剖尸体更加可能，可以检查整个身体。当我是个医学学生的时候，我用了8个月解剖一个尸体，在解剖日，我的衣服和指甲不是尸体腐烂的臭味，而是保存用的化学品味道。我解剖的是一个老人的身体，在那几个月中我对这位老人变得非常熟悉。我们解剖的顺序和Vesalius那时候没什么区别，除了我们会最后解剖大脑，因为这是一个非常复杂的器官，而在那个时候解剖，我们应该可以很小心的割开尸体了。这位老人将尸体捐献给了科学研究，他当然教会了我很多。

Despite the speed needed, and the smells he confronted, dissection was Vesalius's great passion in life. We cannot know how many bodies he carefully cut apart, but it must have been many, for he came to know more about the parts of the human body than anyone then alive. The five and a half years between the time Vesalius became a teacher in Padua and the publication of his great book, in 1543, were very busy. Vesalius's book is enormous, forty centimeters high and weighing nearly two kilograms - not exactly a paper-back you could slip in your pocket for holiday reading. It was called De Hurnani coporis fabrica ('On the structure of the human body'), and it is still known as De Fabrica. It was beautifully and intricately illustrated. Vesalius traveled to Basel, in Switzerland, to supervise the printing of the text and the making of the illustrations.

尽管解剖需要速度，而且会遇到很多臭味，解剖仍然是Vesalius生命中的具有激情的事。我们不知道他小心的切开了多少尸体，但肯定很多，因为他逐渐成为那个时代对人体知识最丰富的人。在Vesalius成为Padua大学的老师和他1543年发表其巨作之间的五年半，他非常忙碌。Vesalius的书非常宏大，有40厘米高，重量接近2公斤，并不是那种假日阅读可以轻易放进口袋的书。书名是《论人体的结构》（De Hurnani coporis fabrica），现在称之为De Fabrica。书中的语言优美而复杂，Vesalius旅行到瑞士的Basel，监督书本的印刷和制图。

We live in a world where illustrations are everywhere. Digital cameras make it easy to send pictures to our friends, and magazines and newspapers have pictures on every page. It was not like that in Vesalius's day. The printing press had been invented less than a hundred years before, and pictures had to be made from carefully carved blocks of wood, copied from a drawing. Like a rubber stamp, these blocks were then inked and pressed on a piece of paper.

我们生活在到处都是插图的世界里，用数字摄像头拍摄并发送给朋友照片非常容易，杂志和报纸在每一页都有图片。在Vesalius的时代并不是这样，印刷机发明还不足一百年，图片需要小心的用雕刻的木块复制图片来制作。就像橡皮图章一样，这些木块沾上墨水然后印在纸上。

The pictures in Vesalius's book are staggering: never before had the human body been depicted so accurately, or in such detail. Even the title page tells us that something special is happening. It shows the dissection of a woman, in public, with hundreds of people crowding around. Vesalius stands in the middle, by the woman's body, and he is the only person looking out at the reader. The rest of the audience is either fascinated by the dissection or gossiping with each other. On the left of the picture is a monkey, on the right a dog, reminders that Galen had had to use animals for his anatomical work. In his own book, Vesalius is talking about human anatomy, from human bodies, and doing the dissecting himself. It was a wonderfully daring thing for a young man of not yet thirty.

Vesalius书中的图片令人吃惊，从来没有将人体的结构描述的如此精确，或者描述的细节如此细致。即使是标题页也告诉我们这里的内容很特殊，他在公众场合展示女性身体的解剖结果，有几百个人围观，Vesalius站在中央，在女性尸体的旁边，只有他一个看向观众，其他观众要么被解剖所吸引，要么在互相闲聊。画面左边是一只猴子，右边是一只狗，提醒人们盖伦是用动物来进行解剖工作。在他自己的书中，Vesalius是用人体来进行解剖学的讨论，并且亲自进行解剖。这对于一个不到30岁的年轻人来说是一件美妙大胆的事。

But, then, Vesalius had every reason to be confident. He knew that he had seen further into the human body than anyone. Among the magnificent pictures in his book are those showing the muscles of the body, front and back, with the muscles nearer the surface dissected away to expose the deeper ones. These 'muscle men' are posed against landscapes, and the buildings, trees, rocks and hillsides in the pictures all join up. One of Vesalius's muscle men is being hanged by the neck, a reminder that Vesalius often used criminals for his dissections. Indeed, he once found a criminal who had been hanged and his body had been picked clean by birds, leaving only his skeleton. Vesalius smuggled the bones back to his room one by one, in order to study in private.

但那时，Vesalius有足够的理由非常自信，他知道他比任何人都更了解人体。在他书中的那些壮丽的图片展示着人体的肌肉，包括人前面和后面的肌肉，将人体皮肤表层的肌肉解剖掉，露出深层的肌肉。这些“肌肉人”与风景、建筑、树木、石头、山坡一起组成图片。Vesalius的一个肌肉人是在脖子那里被吊着的，这提醒人们Vesalius经常使用罪犯来解剖。确实，他有一次找到一具吊死的罪犯的尸体，身体已经被鸟吃完了，只有骸骨。Vesalius将骨头一根一根偷回到他的房间来，然后私下里进行研究。

Vesalius had a very skilled artist to work with him, although we don't know his name for sure. Science was closely linked with art during this period, which we call the Renaissance, 're-birth’. Many Renaissance artists - Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), Michelangelo (1475-1564}, and others- dissected bodies in order to learn how to paint them better. Doctors weren't the only ones who wanted to know about the structure of the human body.

Vesalius有一个娴熟的艺术家同事和他一起工作，但我们仍不知道他的确切名字。在这个时代科学与艺术连接的非常紧密，这是文艺复兴的时代，“重生”。许多文艺复兴的艺术家，达芬奇（1452-1519），米开朗基罗（1475-1564）以及其他人，都会解剖尸体来研究如何将人体画的更好。不止是医生想了解人体的结构。

Vesalius was fascinated by the structure (anatomy) of the body, but dead bodies do not carry out functions (physiology) like breathing, digesting and moving, as living ones do. So the long written part of Vesalius's book was a mix of old and new ideas. He often pointed out how Galen had described some organ or muscle incorrectly and he set it right. For instance, when Galen described the liver, he was talking about the pig's liver, which has five distinct 'lobes', or sections. The human liver has four, which are not so clearly defined. Several muscles in human hands and feet are different from those of even our close kin, monkeys and apes. Galen's theory of how the blood moves required a little of it to move from the right side of the heart to the left; he had it seeping through tiny pores in the wall between the two big chambers (ventricles) of the heart. Vesalius dissected many human hearts and could not find these pores. His knowledge would be very important a few decades later when William Harvey began to think in more detail about what the heart and blood do. Yet Vesalius's discussion of how the living body works still used many of Galen's ideas. This is perhaps why Vesalius's pictures were so much more valued than his writing: the pictures were soon copied and used throughout Europe, and made Vesalius famous (even if they did not earn him much money).

Vesalius对人体结构非常着迷，但尸体并没有生理机能，像呼吸、消化、运动这样的活体机能。所以Vesalius的大部书是新旧观点的混合体。他经常指出盖伦如何错误的描述了某部器官或肌肉，然后他进行了纠正。比如，盖伦描述肝脏时，他描述的是猪的肝脏，是有5个清晰的叶的，而人的肝脏则是有4个，这个定义就没那么精确了。人手上和脚上的几块肌肉甚至与我们的近亲，猴子和猿类的都不一样。盖伦关于血液运行的理论是血液从心脏的右边流到左边，他认为血液从两个心房（心室）中间的墙上的毛穴中渗透。Vesalius解剖了很多人的心脏，但没有发现这些毛穴。他的这些知识在几十年后当William Harvey更认真的思考心脏和血液运行的细节时非常重要。但Vesalius在讨论活体工作机理的时候仍然使用了很多盖伦的观点。这可能是因为Vesalius的图片比他的文字更有价值，这些图片很快就被全欧洲复制并使用，并让Vesalius出名（这并没有让他得到更多金钱）。

Although he lived for another twenty years, the publication of his great book was the highlight of Vesalius's career. He did produce a second edition of the book, with a few corrections, but soon after the first edition was published, he went off to be a court doctor. He spent his time taking care of the rich and powerful. Perhaps he thought he had said everything he had to say.

虽然他又活了20年，但其著作的出版是Vesalius生涯的最高点。他没有再版这本书，只进行了几处修改，但第一版出版后不久，他去做了一个宫廷医生。他的时间花在了照顾富人和强人上，可能他认为他已经说了所有必需说的话。

He had said and done enough to make sure that he was remembered. De Fabrica remains one of the great books of all time: a combination of art, anatomy and printing that is still admired today. And with it Vesalius left us two permanent gifts. First, he encouraged other doctors to continue his minute descriptions of the structure of the human body. Later anatomists discovered other parts of the body that Vesalius had missed, or corrected errors that he had made. The mix of artistic presentation and careful dissection that he had started encouraged others to produce books that illustrated the body on the page. Vesalius's book was the first in which the pictures were more important than the writing, but it was not the last. Doctors needed to be taught how to see what was before them, and pictures were essential to help them learn.

他已经说了做了足够多的事，这使得他被后人铭记。De Fabrica一直是人类所有时代最伟大的著作之一，其综合了艺术、解剖学和印刷术，直到今天仍然为人所敬仰。通过这本著作Vesalius给我们留下了两个永恒的礼物。第一，他鼓励了其他医生继续详细描述人体结构。后世的解剖学家发现了Vesalius疏漏的其他身体部分，或者是纠正了他犯的错误。他开启的艺术展示与仔细解剖的结合鼓励了其他人也在写书的时候在页面上画出人体插图。Vesalius的书是第一本图片比文字重要的书，但不是最后一本。需要教其他医生怎样观察眼前的事物，图片最能帮助他们学习这种技能。

Second, Vesalius stood up to Galen. He wasn't rude about him, like Paracelsus, but he quietly showed that one could know more than Galen had. He showed that knowledge can grow from generation to generation. He helped begin a debate that lasted for more than a hundred years. The question was simple: Can we know more than the Ancients? In the thousand years before Vesalius, the answer had been No. After Vesalius, the answer began gradually to change. People started to think: ‘If everything worth knowing has already been discovered, what's the point of bothering? But if I look for myself, maybe I can see something that no one else has seen.’ Vesalius encouraged doctors and scientists to start bothering.

第二，Vesalius勇敢的面对了盖伦。他对盖伦的观点并不粗鲁，这是Paracelsus的特点，但他很平静的展示了，一个人可以比盖伦知道的更多。他展示了，知识可以一代一代成长。他开启了一场辩论，持续了一百多年，问题非常简单：我们可以比古代先贤知道的更多吗？在Vesalius之前的上千年里，答案是不会。在Vesalius之后，答案逐渐得到改变。人们开始认为，“如果所有值得知道的事都已经被发现了，担心的意义在哪里呢？但如果找寻自己，或许可能看到别人未曾看到的事情”。Vesalius鼓励医生和科学家开始担心。

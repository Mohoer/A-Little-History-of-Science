# CHAPTER 32 The Game-Changer Einstein
# 第32章 游戏规则改变者-爱因斯坦

Albert Einstein (1879-1955) is famous for his shock of white hair and his theories about matter, energy, space and time. And the equation E=mc2. His ideas might be frighteningly hard to understand, but they changed the way we think about the universe. He was once asked what his laboratory looked like. By way of answer, he whipped out his fountain pen from his pocket. This was because Einstein was a thinker, not a doer. He worked at a desk or chalkboard rather than the laboratory bench.

阿尔伯特•爱因斯坦（1879-1955）由于其白色的爆炸头发而著名，同样也因为关于物质、能量、空间和时间的理论而著名，还有公式E=mc2。他的理论可能非常难懂，但他改变了我们对这个宇宙的看法。有一次有人问他的实验室是什么样子，他拿出了口袋里的钢笔作为回答。这是因为爱因斯坦是一位思想家，而不是实干家，他在办公桌或黑板前工作，而不是在实验台前工作。

Still, he needed the kind of information that could be gained by experiment, and in particular he would come to rely upon the work of the German physicist Max Planck (1858-1947). Planck was a thinker and an experimenter. He was about forty years old when he made his most fundamental discovery, at the University of Berlin. In the 1890s he started working on light bulbs, to see how he could produce a bulb that gave out the maximum light but used the least electricity. In his experiments he was using the idea of a 'black body', a hypothetical object that absorbs all the light shone onto it, reflecting none back. Think how hot you get wearing a black T-shirt in the sunshine, and how much cooler it is to wear a white one: the black clothing has absorbed the energy from the sunlight. So, the energy that comes with the light is absorbed by the black body. But it cannot simply store all this energy, so how does the black body give it back out again?

但他仍然需要实验得到的信息，特别是需要依靠德国物理学家Max Planck（1858-1947）的工作。Planck是一位思想家也是一位实验者，当他做出最重要的发现时，他大约40岁，在柏林大学工作。在19世纪90年代他开始研究灯泡，看看怎样才能制造出用最少的电发出最多的光的灯泡。在他的试验中他使用了黑体的概念，黑体是一个假设的物体，可以吸收所有照射到其上面的光，完全不会反射。想想你在烈日下穿一件黑T恤是多热，而穿一件白T恤会凉快的多，这是因为黑色衣服会从阳光中吸收热量。所以光线中的能量被黑体所吸收，但黑体不能存储所有的能量，那么它怎样释放能量呢？

Planck knew that the amount of energy absorbed depends on the particular wavelength (the frequency) of the light. He took his very careful measurements of the energy and wavelength and put them into the mathematical equation E=hv. The energy (E) is equal to the frequency of the wavelength (v) multiplied by a fixed number (a 'constant' - h). In this equation the energy output Planck measured was always a whole number, not a fraction. This was important because being a fixed number meant that the energy came in individual little packets. He called each of these little packets a ‘quantum’, which just meant a quantity. He published his work in 1900, introducing the idea of the quantum to the new century. Physics, and how we understand our world, have never been quite the same since. The fixed number (h) was called 'Planck's constant' in his honor. His equation would prove just as important as Einstein's more famous E = mc2.

Planck知道吸收的能量取决于光线的波长（或频率），他很小心的测量了能量和波长的关系，得出了公式E=hv，也就是能量E等于频率v乘以一个固定常数h。在这个公式中，Planck测量出的能量永远是一个整数，而不是分数。这很重要，说明能量是以很小的能量包为单位进来的。他称这些小的能量包为“量子”，意为一个数量。他在1900年发表了他的工作结果，将量子的概念引入了新的世纪。物理，和我们如何理解世界，从没有这样一致过。为了纪念他，这个固定的常数h被称为Planck常数。这个公式后来认为与爱因斯坦的著名公式E=mc2一样重要。

It took some physicists a while to appreciate the real significance of Planck's experiments. Einstein was one who saw what it meant straight away. In 1905, he was working in the Zurich Patent Office as a clerk, and doing physics in his spare time. That year, he published three papers that made his name. The first, which won him a Nobel Prize in 1921, took Planck's work to a new level. Einstein thought more about Planck's black body radiation, and drew on the still-new quantum approach. After much thought, he showed - by some brilliant calculations - that the light was indeed being transmitted in small packages of energy. These packets moved independently of each other even though together they made up a wave. This was a startling claim, for physicists since Thomas Young a century before had analyzed light in many experimental situations as if it were a continuous wave. It certainly generally behaved that way, and here was a young, still obscure, worker in a patent office saying that light could be a particle – a photon, or quantum of light.

一些科学家过了挺长时间才认识到Planck实验的重要性。爱因斯坦立刻就看出了其中的意义，1905年，他在苏黎世专利办公室做一个小职员，业余时间做物理研究。在那一年，他发表了3篇论文，确定了他名字的地位。第一篇文章将Planck的工作带到了一个新高度，因为这篇文章他在1921年获得了一个诺贝尔奖。爱因斯坦在Planck的黑体辐射中思考了更多，并利用了新的量子方法。经过深思熟虑和精确演算之后，他说明了光确实是以很小块的能量为单位传播的。虽然共同组成了波，但这些小块能量仍然各自独立的运动。一个世纪前的物理学家Thomas Young已经在很多实验中分析了光是一种连续波，所以这是一个非常震惊的结论。一般来说，光当然是以波的形式存在，但现在一个年轻的无名的专利办公室工作人员说，光可以是一种粒子 – 光子，或者光量子。

Einstein's next paper from 1905 was equally revolutionary. This was where he introduced his Special Theory of Relativity, which showed that all movement is relative, that is, it can only be measured in relation to something else. It is a very complicated theory, but can be explained quite simply if you use your imagination. (Einstein was a great one for deep thinking about known data and exploring, in his mind, what would happen if...?) Imagine a train is moving out of a station. In the middle of one of the carriages there is a light bulb flashing on and off, sending out a flash at exactly the same time forwards and backwards, which is reflected in a mirror at each end of the carriage. If you were standing exactly in the middle of the carriage you would see the light bounce back from both mirrors at exactly the same time. But someone standing on the platform as the train went past would see the flashes one after the other. Although both flashes are still hitting the mirrors simultaneously, the train is moving forwards, so on the platform you would see the flash from the furthest-away mirror (at the front of the carriage) before you saw the flash from the closer mirror (at the back). So, although the speed of light remains the same, when it is seen is different depending on - or rather, relative to – whether the observer is moving or still. Einstein argued (with the help of some complicated equations, of course) that time is a fundamental dimension of reality. From now on physicists would need to think not simply of the three familiar dimensions of space - length, width and height - but of time, too.

爱因斯坦1905年的第二篇论文同样非常具有革命性。这篇论文里他提出了狭义相对论，指出所有的运动都是相对的，也就是说，运动必须以其他事物为参照来测量。这是个非常复杂的理论，但如果运用想象力会很容易解释（爱因斯坦非常善于对现有的数据和实验进行深度思考，在他的脑海里一直都是如果…会发生什么呢？）。想象一下一列火车开出车站，在其中一节车厢中有一个灯泡忽亮忽灭，在同一时刻向前向后发出光亮，在车厢两头的镜子中都反射了回来，如果你站在车厢正中间，会发现光同时从两边的镜子反射回来。但在站台上站着的某个人在火车开过的时候，会发现光是一个接一个亮起来的。虽然两束光仍然同时到达镜子，但火车是在向前开的，所以在站台上，你会看到先看到远处的（车厢前面）镜子反射回来的光，然后再看到近处的（车厢后面）镜子反射的光。所以，虽然光的速度仍然是相同的，但何时看到光却决定于观察者是静止的还是运动的。爱因斯坦以几个复杂的公式说明了时间是现实的一个基础维度。从现在开始，物理学家在思考三维空间的长宽高时，还必须考虑时间。

Einstein showed that the speed of light is constant, no matter whether it is moving away from or towards us. (The speed of sound is different, which is why a train sounds different depending on whether we hear it approaching or moving away.) So the relativity in the Special Theory of Relativity doesn't apply to this constant speed of light. Instead the relativity occurs in the observers and in the fact that time needs to be included. Time is not absolute but relative. It changes the faster we travel and so do the clocks that record it for us. There is an old story about an astronaut traveling near the speed of light and coming back to earth to find that time has moved on. Everyone she knew has grown old and died. She is not much older that when she left, but as her clock has slowed down she is not aware of how long she has been away. (This is just a thought experiment and could happen only in science fiction.)

爱因斯坦向大家展示，光速是不变的，不论是光在朝向我们还是远离我们运动（声音的速度是不一样的，这就是为什么火车朝向或远离我们运动时声音不一样），所以狭义相对论对光速不适用。但相对性是发生在观察者这里的，所以在这种情况下时间也不许被考虑进去。时间不是绝对的，而是相对的。当我们运动速度非常快的时候，时间也会改变，计时的钟也会改变。有一个很老的关于宇航员的故事，他以光速旅行，然后回到地球，发现地球上的时间快了，所有她认识的人都老了、去世了，她没有比离开的时候老多少，但是由于她的时钟变慢了，她也没有意识到她离开了多长时间（这只是一个想象的实验，只能发生在科幻之中）。

As if that wasn't enough, Einstein's famous equation E = mc2 brought together mass (m) and energy (E) in a new way. The c is the velocity of light. In effect, he showed that mass and energy were two aspects of matter. Since the velocity of light is a very big number, and, when squared, an even bigger one, this means that only a very small amount of mass, if completely converted to energy, would be a lot of energy. Even atomic bombs convert only a tiny fraction of the mass to energy. If the mass in your body were totally converted into energy, it would have the force of fifteen large hydrogen bombs. Don't try the experiment, however.

好像还不足够一样，爱因斯坦著名的公式E=mc2将质量m与能量E产生了新的联系，c为光速。他告诉我们质量和能量是物质的两种存在方式。由于光速是非常巨大的数字，平方以后更加大，这告诉我们即使很少的质量也可能转化为非常多的能量。即使是原子弹，转化为能量的质量也是非常小的。如果你身体的质量全部转化为能量，将有15个氢弹的能量。尽管如此，还是不要做这个实验的好。

Over the next few years, Einstein extended his thinking, and in 1916 he came up with a more general framework for the universe. This was his General Theory of Relativity. It introduced his ideas on the relationship between gravity and acceleration, and the structure of space. He showed that gravity and acceleration were actually equivalent. Imagine you are standing in a lift, and you drop an apple from your hand: it will fall to the floor of the lift. Now, if you let go of the apple at exactly the same moment that someone cuts the cord of the lift, you will fall along with the apple. It won't actually move, relative to you, as you both fall together. At any time, you can simply reach out and take hold of the apple. It will never reach the floor so long as the lift (and you) continue to fall. This is of course what happens in space, where there is no gravity. Astronauts and their spacecraft are essentially in free fall.

在以后的几年里，爱因斯坦拓展了这个思想，在1916年他为宇宙提出了一种广义的多的框架，这就是广义相对论。他提出了重力与加速度的关系的理论，和空间的结构的理论。他告诉我们，重力和加速度其实是等价的。假设你在一个电梯里，你从手中丢下一个苹果，那么它会掉到电梯地板上。现在，如果你在丢下苹果的同时，有人切断了电梯的缆绳，你将会和苹果一样掉落。当你和苹果都在掉落的时候，苹果相对于你实际上并没有移动，在任何时刻，你都可以伸出手就抓到苹果，当电梯和你都在掉落的时候，苹果永远不会掉到电梯地板上。这当然是在太空中才能发生的事情，那里没有重力。宇航员和空间飞船实际上都是在自由落体状态。

Einstein's General Theory of Relativity demonstrated that space, or rather space-time, is curved. It made predictions about several puzzling things that physicists had had difficulty in explaining. It suggested that light would be slightly bent when it passed near a large body. This was because light (made up of photons) has mass, and the larger body would exert a gravitational pull on the smaller mass of light. Measurements during an eclipse of the sun showed that this actually happens. Einstein's theory also explained curious features of the orbit of Mars around the sun, which Newton's less complex laws of gravity could not do.

爱因斯坦的广义相对论展示了空间是弯曲的，这对几个物理学家觉得难于解释的困惑事件提出了预测。他提出，光在经过一个巨大物体的时候，将会被弯曲少许，这是因为光子是有重量的，巨大物体将会对光子施加一个引力的影响。日食时的测量也证实了这确实会发生。爱因斯坦的理论也解释了火星围绕太阳转动时的奇怪特征，而牛顿简单的重力公式解释不了。

Einstein had worked with the very small (the tiny photons of light) and the very large (the universe itself). He offered a compelling new way of bringing them together. In this he contributed to quantum theory as well as introducing his own ideas of relativity. These ideas, and the mathematics behind them, helped define the way physicists thought about both the large and the small. But Einstein did not approve of many of the new directions that physics was taking. He never lost his belief that the universe (with its atoms, electrons and other particles) is locked in a system of cause and effect. He famously said, 'God does not play at dice: He meant that things always happen in regular, predictable patterns. Not everyone agreed, and other physicists who took on Planck's quantum ideas came to different conclusions.

爱因斯坦的工作对象是非常小（光子）和非常大（宇宙本身）的物质，他提出了一种全新的方式将其统和在一起。这里他既对量子理论有了贡献，也提出了他自己的相对论的思想。这些想法和其后的数学，让物理学家重新认识巨大物体和微小物体。但爱因斯坦并不赞成现代物理的很多研究方向，他一直相信宇宙（和其中的原子，电子和其他粒子）是由一种因果关系所主宰的。他的名言，“上帝不掷色子”，意思是事物都有其有规律的、可预测的运动方式。并不是所有人都同意这一点，有些接受了Planck的量子理论的物理学家得到了不同的结论。

The electron was central to much of the other early quantum work. Chapter 30 explained Niels Bohr's model of the quantum atom, in 1913. He had the electrons in fixed orbits with definite energies whizzing around the central nucleus. A lot of work was done trying to explain these relationships mathematically. Ordinary maths didn't work. To solve this problem, physicists turned to matrix mathematics. In ordinary maths, 2×3 is the same as 3×2. In matrix maths, this isn't so, and these special tools allowed an Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrodinger (1887-1961), to develop new equations in 1926. His wave equations described the behavior of the electrons in the outer orbits of the atom. This was the beginning of quantum mechanics. It did for the very small what Newton had done for the very large. Like many of the physicists who changed the way we think about the world in the early twentieth century, Schrodinger had to flee the Nazis, and spent the war years in Dublin. Einstein, as we know, went to United States.

电子对于早期的量子理论的工作非常重要。第30章Niels Bohr 1913年量子原子的模型，他将电子围绕原子核运动轨道固定，每个轨道都有其能级。为了解释其中的关系，做了很多数学工作。传统数学工具没能起作用，为了解决这个问题，利用了矩阵这个数学工具。在传统数学中，2×3和3×2是一样的，在矩阵计算中，这是不一样的，这个工具使奥地利物理学家Erwin Schrodinger（1887-1961）在1926年发明了新的公式。他的波动方程描述了电子在原子外围轨道的运动行为，这是量子力学的开始，牛顿对宏观物体提出了运动公式，他为微观粒子做了相同的工作。20世纪初，很多物理学家改变了我们对世界的看法，他们都被纳粹所迫害，Schrodinger逃到了Dublin。爱因斯坦去了美国。

Schrodinger's wave equations brought some order into the picture. Then Werner Heisenberg (1901-76) came up with the 'uncertainty principle' in 1927. The principle was part philosophy, part experiment. Heisenberg said that the very act of experimenting with electrons changes them. This places limits on what we can know. We could know an electron's momentum (its mass multiplied by its speed), or its position, but not both. Measuring one affected the other. Einstein (among others) was appalled by this idea, and set about disproving Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. He couldn't. Einstein admitted defeat. So far the principle remains intact: there are simply limits to our knowledge of the very small.

Schrodinger的波动方程为微观世界的运动提供了一些规则，接着Wener Heisenberg（1901-76）在1927年提出了测不准原理，这个原理是半哲学半实验性质的。Heisenberg说对电子的实验本身就会对它造成影响，这使得我们的认识有了限制。我们可以知道一个电子的动量（质量乘以速度），也可以知道其位置，但不可能同时知道动量和位置，对其中一个量的测量会影响到另一个量。爱因斯坦和其他很多人对这个想法感到非常诧异，并着手证明Heisenberg的测不准原理是错误的。爱因斯坦没有做到这一点，他承认了失败，直到现在这个原理仍然保持原样：我们对微观世界的认知是有局限的。

The electron was also crucial to Paul Dirac(1902-84). This complex Englishman was considered to be almost another Einstein. His book on quantum mechanics led the field for three decades. His own equations about the quantum activities of atoms and sub-atomic particles were little short of brilliant. The trouble was, his equations required a strange particle - a positively charged electron - in order to work. This was like saying that there was both matter and anti-matter. The whole idea of ‘anti-matter’ was bizarre, since matter is the solid stuff of the universe. Within a few years, the search for such a particle was successful and the positron was discovered. This twin to the electron had a single positive charge. It combined with an electron, produced a burst of energy and then both particles disappeared. Matter and anti-matter could annihilate each other in less than the blink of an eye.

电子对于Paul Dirac（1902-84）也很重要。这个复杂的英国人几乎就是另一个爱因斯坦。他的量子力学的书引领了这个学科长达三十年，他关于原子和亚原子粒子的量子行为的公式非常精彩。麻烦之处在于，他的公式需要一个带正电荷的电子才能成立。这就像说同时有物质和反物质一样。关于“反物质”的整个想法都是非常奇特的，因为物质是宇宙中实际普遍存在的东西。几年后，对这种粒子的寻找就有了结果，正电子找到了。这个电子的孪生兄弟带有一个正电荷，和电子结合后，会产生一个能量脉冲，然后两个粒子都会消失。物质和反物质都在瞬间湮灭彼此。

The positron showed physicists that atoms were composed of more than protons, electrons and neutrons. We look at some of these profound discoveries later, after physicists produced ever-higher energies to examine their atoms and particles. 'Examine' is not quite the right word. When working with high energy, physicists cannot actually see directly what is going on in their experiments. What they see instead are spots on a computer screen, or changes in the magnetism or energy of their experimental set-up. But atomic bombs, atomic energy and even the possibility of quantum computing all testify to nature's power and mystery - even if we cannot see it.

正电子的存在说明原子可能不止由质子，电子和中子组成。当物理学家创造出更高的能量来查看原子和粒子时，我们再来看看这个意义深远的发现。“查看”用的并不是太确切。因为在用高能方法研究时，物理学家并不是确切的看到实验中粒子发生了什么，他们看到的是在计算机显示器上的点，或者实验设置的磁场或能量场的改变。但原子弹，原子能甚至是量子计算的可能都在证明自然的能量和神秘，即使我们看不到它。

Max Planck's packet, or quantum, of energy, and Albert Einstein's realization that mass and energy are merely two aspects of the same thing: these discoveries changed forever the way that the universe could be understood. Mass and energy; wave and particle; time and space: nature has revealed herself to be ‘both ... and ...’, not ‘either ... or …’. And while all this helped explain the structure of atoms and the creation of the universe, it also helps you get home at night. Satellites are so far above the earth that Satnav must include special relativity. If it weren't factored in, you could soon get lost.

Max Planck的单位包，或者能量的量子，和爱因斯坦意识到质量和能量是同样的物质的两种形式：这些发现永远的改变了理解宇宙的方式。质量和能量，波和粒子，时间和空间，自然是一种“既是…也是…”的方式，而不是“不是…而是…”的方式。这既对解释原子的结构和宇宙的形成有帮助，也对你夜里安全到家有帮助，卫星正在地球轨道运行，卫星导航必须要用到狭义相对论，如果不考虑到这个因素，你很快就会迷路。

# CHAPTER 23 Digging Up Dinosaurs
# 第23章 挖出恐龙

When I was very young, I had problems telling the difference between dinosaurs and dragons. In pictures, they often look alike, with huge teeth, powerful jaws, scaly skin and evil eyes, and they are sometimes shown attacking some other creature around them. Both kinds of creatures are clearly the sort that it is best to avoid. 

当我很小的时候，我分不清恐龙和龙。在图片中，它们看起来很像，都有很大的牙齿，有力的下颌，鳞片状的皮肤，邪恶的双眼，有时候还会攻击它们周围的其他动物。这两种动物都很清楚是最该躲开的那种动物。

There is a significant difference between dinosaurs and dragons, however. Dragons appear in Greek myths, legends about England's King Arthur, Chinese New Year parades, and in many dramas throughout human history. But even if their power is such that they still feature in stories created today, they were always the products of the human imagination. Dragons never existed. 

但恐龙与龙之间有很大的不同。龙出现在希腊关于英国阿瑟王的神话传说中，出现在中国新年游行中，在人类历史中的很多戏剧中。即使在今天创造的故事中还是有强大的力量，但它们始终都是人类想象力的产物。龙从来没有存在过。

Dinosaurs, however, did once live. They were here for a very long time, even if human beings never saw them. They thrived around 200 million years ago, and we know about them because their bones have been preserved as fossils. The discovery of these bones in the early nineteenth century was an important step for science. First geologists, and then ordinary people, began to realize that the earth is far older than people had assumed. 

但恐龙确实存在过，即使人类从没见过它们，但它们确实存在了很久。它们最兴旺的时候是在2亿年前，我们能知道它们的存在，是因为它们的骨头保存在了化石中。19世纪早期发现了这些骨头，这是科学的重要一步。首先是地质学家，然后是普通人，都意识到地球比他们认为的要古老的多。

The word 'palaeontology' was coined in France, in 1822, to give scientists a name for the study of fossils. Fossils are the outlines of parts of animals and plants that were once alive, but have slowly turned to stone (petrified) after they died, when the conditions are right. Fossils can be admired in many museums, and collecting them is fun. It is harder today, since a lot of the easy fossils have already been gathered for study and display. But in some places, like Lyme Regis on the south coast of England, the cliffs are still being eroded by the waves of the sea, and here fossils often come to light. 

“古生物学”这个词是1822年最先在法国杜撰的，给研究化石的科学取了个名字。化石是曾经一度存活的动植物的部分轮廓，死后逐渐变成了石头（石化），当然要在条件合适的时候。很多博物馆都在有化石供人们参观，收集化石也是很有趣的事。因为容易找到的化石都已经收集用于研究或展览了，今天寻找化石更难一些。但在一些区域，比如英国南海岸线的Lyme Regis，悬崖仍然不断的被海浪侵蚀，所以这里经常出现化石。

People have been coming upon fossils for thousands of years. Originally, the word 'fossil' just meant 'anything dug up', so 'fossils' might be old coins, pieces of pottery, or a nice quartz rock. But many of these objects buried in the earth looked like the shells, teeth or bones of animals, and gradually 'fossil' came to mean just these things that looked like bits of creatures. Shells of sea animals were sometimes found on mountain tops, far from the sea. Often the stony bones, teeth and shells didn't seem to be like those of any known animal. In the 1600s, when naturalists began to puzzle about what had been found, they developed three sorts of explanation. First, some believed that these shapes had been produced by a special force within nature, striving, but failing, to create new kinds of organisms. They were similar to living plants and animals, but hadn't quite made it. Secondly, others argued that fossils were really the remains of species of animals or plants that had simply not yet been discovered. So much of the earth itself remained unexplored, that these creatures would eventually be found in remote parts of the world, or in the oceans. A third group of scholars dared to suggest these organisms were creatures that had once been alive but were now extinct. If that was true, then the earth must be much older than most people thought. 

几千年来人们一直都在遇到化石。最开始，“化石”的意思就是“挖出来的东西”，所以“化石”也可能是古硬币，陶器碎片，或好看的石英石。但很多这些埋在土里的东西都看起来像贝壳、动物的牙齿或骨头，所以“化石”的意思逐渐成为了看起来像生物残余的东西。海洋生物的贝壳有时候在高山顶发现，离大海非常遥远。那些石质的骨头、牙齿和贝壳经常看起来不像是任何已知生物的。在17世纪，当博物学家想弄清楚到底发现的是什么东西时，他们发展出了三套解释。第一，有的相信是自然中特殊的力量努力创造新的生物，但是失败了，所以产生了这些形状。它们与活着的动植物相似，但没有成形。第二，别的人相信化石只是还没发现的动植物的物种的残余。地球本身还有很多地方尚未探索，那些生物可能最终在世界某个偏远的角落被发现，或者在海洋里。第三类学者勇敢建议，这些生物曾经是活着的，但现在已经灭绝了。如果是真的，那么地球一定比人们想象的要更加古老。

It was not until the eighteenth century that the word 'fossil' got its modern meaning, that of the petrified remains of a plant or animal that had once been alive. The realization of what this meant began to dominate scientific thinking. The scientist who convinced the world that some animals had become extinct was a Frenchman, Georges Cuvier (1769-1832). Cuvier was very good at anatomy, especially comparing the anatomy of different kinds of animals. He had a special interest in fish but also a vast knowledge of the whole animal kingdom. He dissected hundreds of different animals, then he compared the different parts of their bodies and explored what all their various organs did. He argued that animals are living machines in which every part has its proper purpose. He also noticed that everything in an animal's body worked together. For instance, animals that eat meat have canines (sharp teeth), which permit them to tear the flesh of their prey. They have the correct digestive system, muscles, and all other characteristics they need to catch and live on meat. Those that graze on plants, like cows and sheep, have teeth with flattened ends, which help in grinding grass and hay. Their bone structure and muscles are for standing around rather than running and pouncing. 

直到18世纪“化石”这个词语才有了现代的意义，也就是曾经活着的动植物的石化残余。这种思想逐渐占据了科学界。说服了世界一些生物已经灭绝的科学家是法国人，Georges Cuvier (1769-1832)。Cuvier擅长解剖学，尤其擅长不同动物的解剖比较。他对鱼有特殊的兴趣，但对整个动物世界都知之甚深。他解剖了数百种不同的动物，然后对它们身体的不同部分进行了比较，分析了所有不同的器官的功能。他认为动物是活的机器，每个部位都有其适当用处。他还注意到动物体内所有器官是协同工作的，比如，吃肉的动物有犬齿（尖锐的牙齿），这使它们可以撕裂猎物的肉，它们还有合适的消化系统、肌肉以及所有其他特征，这样才可以抓住猎物，以肉为生。而草食动物比如牛和羊，其牙齿平坦，有助于碾碎青草和干草，它们的骨架和肌肉更是为站立和漫游，而不是为跑和猛扑。

Cuvier's belief that animals are so beautifully constructed that the whole fits together in harmony made it possible for him to say a lot about an animal's structure and mode of life just by looking at one part of it. Find a canine tooth and you have found a carnivore, he said, and he would apply the same principles to fossils. With another anatomist he undertook a thorough investigation of the fossils found around Paris. They discovered that the fossils often resembled parts in living animals that could still be found in the area, but in many cases the teeth and bones had small, but significant, differences. By chance, the frozen remains of a large elephant were found in Siberia. Cuvier examined this 'woolly mammoth', as it was called, and argued that it was not only unlike any known living elephant, but that an animal of this size would surely have been noticed before, were it still roaming around somewhere. So it must have become extinct. 

Cuvier相信动物各部分构成优美，各部分协调运作，所以他只需要看看动物身体的一部分，就可以说出动物结构和生活模式的很多内容。他说，发现一只犬牙，就发现了一个肉食动物，这个原则他也应用于化石。和另一位解剖学家一起，他们对巴黎附近的化石进行了彻底的调查。他们发现化石与仍然在这个区域生活的动物的身体部分很像，但牙齿和骨头常常有很小但明显的不同。很偶然的，在西伯利亚发现了一头大象的冰冻残余，Cuvier调查了这个“长毛猛犸象”，当时人们这么称呼的，并认为这与任何已知的大象都很不相同，但如果这样体型的动物仍在周围活动，以前肯定会被注意到的，所以这种动物肯定已经灭绝了。

When they accepted the idea that some species of animals (and plants) were now extinct, it was much easier for naturalists to interpret the large numbers of fossils that were then being uncovered. The discoveries of two rather unlikely people in England helped create the notion of a prehistoric world. The first of these was Mary Anning (1799-1847). She was the daughter of a poor carpenter who lived in Lyme Regis, that place in southern England still being eroded by the sea. It was a brilliant place for Mary to hunt for fossils.  Even as a young girl, she went fossil hunting, for good specimens could be sold to scientists and collectors. Mary and her brother Joseph used their local knowledge to develop a business collecting and selling fossils. In 1811 they found the skull, and then many of the other bones, of a strange creature. Estimated to have been seventeen feet long (five meters), it was unlike anything that had ever been found before. It was displayed in Oxford and was soon named Ichthyosaurus, which literally means 'fish-lizard', as it had had fins and so swam in water. Mary went on to find a number of other dramatic fossils, including one that had some resemblance to a giant turtle, but without any evidence that it had ever had a shell. This one was named Plesiosaurus, meaning ‘nearly a reptile’. These discoveries brought her fame and some money. But as fossil hunting caught on, she found the competition fierce and had trouble supporting herself and her family through her business. 

当他们接受了一些动物（植物）物种已经灭绝的概念，博物学家就很容易解释那时候发现的数量众多的化石了。在英国两个很不可能的人的发现，帮助创造了史前世界的概念。第一个是Mary Anning (1799-1847)，他是一个贫穷木匠的女儿，住在Lyme Regis，那个地区在英国南部，仍然在被大海侵蚀，对Mary来说这是个寻找化石的绝佳地点。在很年轻的时候，她就去寻找化石了，因为好的样本可以被卖给科学家和收藏家。Mary和她哥哥Joseph利用对当地的了解创造了收集、出售化石的生意。1811年他们发现了一个头骨，然后发现一种奇怪生物的很多其他骨头，这种动物估计大约有17英尺（5米）长，与以前的任何发现都不一样。这在牛津进行了展览，不久后被命名为Ichthyosaurus，文字意思是鱼蜥蜴，因为它曾经有鳍，可以在水里游泳。Mary继续发现了一些其他神奇的化石，有一个有点像一只巨龟，但却哪里也看不出有壳，这个被命名为Plesiosaurus，意思是“接近一个爬行动物”。这些发现为她带来了名声和金钱，但随着继续发现化石，她发现竞争越来越激烈，这个生意难以支持她和她的家庭。

Mary Anning had little education and lost control over her fossil finds once she had sold them. Gideon Mantell (1790-1852) faced problems of a different kind. He was a family doctor in Lewes, Sussex - also in southern England - and had access to many fossils in limestone quarries nearby. As a doctor he had a good knowledge of anatomy and was able to interpret the fossils. But he had to fit his fossil work around a busy medical practice and a growing family. He turned his house into a kind of fossil museum, which didn't please his wife. Travelling to London to present his findings to the scientists there was a slow and expensive business. 

Mary Anning几乎没受到过什么教育，化石卖掉以后就失去了控制。Gideon Mantell (1790-1852)则面对的是另外一种问题。他是Sussex的Lewes的一个家庭医生，也是在英国南部，可以接触到附近的很多石灰石采石场。作为一个医生，他非常了解解剖学，可以对化石进行解释。但他的家庭很大，医学工作也很忙碌，所以化石工作就要适应这些。他将家放在了一种化石博物馆里，这使他妻子不怎么愉快。旅行去伦敦将他的发现展示给那里的科学家，也是又贵又慢的行动。

Despite these problems, Mantell persisted, and was rewarded by uncovering several exotic beasts. In the 1820s, he found some teeth of a kind not seen before, and the original owner of the teeth was named Iguanodon, meaning 'having a tooth like an iguana' (a kind of tropical lizard). Some admirers gave him a more complete skeleton of the iguanodon that they had found. Mantell also discovered an armored dinosaur, Hylaeosaurus, which confirmed that some of these gigantic creatures walked on land. Others were unearthed that had features of birds, so this strange world had creatures that lived in the sea, on the land and in the air. 

尽管有这些问题，Mantell坚持了下来，并发现了几种奇特的野兽。在19世纪20年代，他发现了一种以前没看到过的牙齿，原主人将牙齿命名为Iguanodon，意思是“有鬣蜥一样的牙齿”（鬣蜥是一种热带蜥蜴）。一些爱慕者给了他一些iguanodon的另一些骨头，使整个骸骨更加完整。Mantell还发现了一种装甲恐龙，Hylaeosaurus，确认了这些巨大生物中的一些是行走在陆地上的。其他发现的有一些鸟的特征，所以这个奇怪的世界的生物有生活在海里的，有在陆地上的，还有空中的。

When we see these enormous, wonderful creatures reconstructed in museums, it is difficult to understand how hard it was for the men and women who first uncovered them. The fossilized bones were often scattered and the skeletons had bits missing. They had only a limited number of living or fossilized animals to compare the findings with, and they had none of the modern techniques of dating their discoveries. They could only estimate the size of their finds by comparing the bones they had discovered - a thigh bone, for example - with large living animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses. The estimated sizes were staggering. They used Cuvier's principle to help reconstruct whole skeletons from the parts and speculate on what the animal might have eaten, how it moved, and whether it lived on land, in the water, in the air, or some combination. A lot of their ideas had to be revised as more dinosaurs were discovered and more was learned about the early history of life on earth. But their findings changed forever how we think about the world we inhabit. 

当我们看到这些巨大美好的生物重建在博物馆，很难理解这对第一次发现它们的那些男女有多难。骨头化石经常是分散的，骸骨还有遗失的部分。他们只有有限几种活着的或者生物化石来与发现进行对比，还没有各种现代技术确定发现物的时期。他们只能通过将发现的骨头（比如大腿骨）与活着的大型动物（比如大象或犀牛）进行比较来估计发现的化石生物的尺寸，估计得出的尺寸是令人吃惊的。他们采用Cuvier的原则帮助用各部分重建整个骸骨，推测这个动物吃什么，怎么走路，是否在陆地上生活，还是在水里或者空中，或者是各种组合。很多他们的主意需要不断修改，因为发现了更多的恐龙，知道了它们在地球上生活的早期历史。但他们的发现永远的改变了我们对自己生活的这个世界的想法。

'Dinosaur hunters' made the general public realize how old the earth was, and how there had been complex creatures living long before human beings appeared. This ancient world captured their imagination, and fanciful pictures appeared in many popular magazines. Writers like Charles Dickens could refer to these giant reptiles, knowing that their readers would understand what they were talking about. The name 'dinosaur' was first used in 1842: it roughly means ‘fearfully great lizard’. New kinds of dinosaurs continued to be uncovered, not only in England but elsewhere. They were quickly integrated into a general history of life on earth, and their period on earth was roughly calculated from the ages of the rocks in which they were found. 

“恐龙猎人”使公众意识到地球的古老程度，以及人类出现之前很久怎么有复杂的生物在这里生活。这个古老的世界吸引了他们的想象力，很多流行杂志上出现了奇幻的图片。像Charles Dickens这样的作家可以参考这些巨大的爬行动物，因为知道他们的读者回理解他们在说什么。“恐龙”这个名字第一次在1842年使用，意思是“可怕的巨大蜥蜴”。新种类的恐龙不断被发现，不仅在英国，还在其他地方。很快就将这些综合成这些生物在地球上的总体历史，它们生存的时期也从发现它们的岩石中粗略得到了估计。

Richard Owen (1804-92), the man who gave them the name ‘dinosaurs’, used his own work on these creatures to further his scientific career. He was behind the building of what today is the Natural History Museum in London. It is a wonderful museum, and the dinosaurs still have a prominent place in it. Many of those on display are original specimens found by people like Mary Anning.

使用“恐龙”这个名字的第一人，Richard Owen (1804-92)，将自己的工作用于这种生物来进一步发展其科学事业。他是背后支持伦敦的现在称为自然历史博物馆的建造的人，这是个美妙的博物馆，恐龙仍然在那里占有显著的位置，那里很多展品是像Mary Anning这样的人发现的化石原标本。

In 1851, London hosted the first in a series of World's Fairs. Called the Great Exhibition, it brought together displays of science, technology, art, transport and culture from all over the world. The Exhibition was housed in a building of amazing daring: the 'Crystal Palace', a gigantic glass house, located in the centre of Hyde Park, right in the heart of London. It was 33 meters tall, 124 meters wide and 563 meters long. People thought you couldn't build anything so large of glass and steel, but Joseph Paxton did. He was a gardener and builder who had experience constructing large greenhouses for Victorian gentlemen. The Exhibition was like nothing that had ever happened before, and six million people from all over the world flocked to see it during the six months it lasted. 

在1851年，伦敦主办了第一次世界博览会，被称为“大展览”，聚集展示了全世界各地的科学、技术、艺术、交通和文化展品。这次展览在一个非常大胆的建筑里，水晶宫，一个巨大的玻璃房间，在海德公园中央，刚好在伦敦的心脏地区。这个建筑33米高，124米宽，563米长。人们认为用玻璃和钢铁不可能建造这么大的建筑，但Joseph Paxton做到了。他是一个园艺师和建筑师，曾经为维多利亚时代的绅士建造过巨大的温室。这次展览史无前例，六百万从世界各地来的人在六个月内不断来进行参观。

When it closed, the Crystal Palace was taken down and moved to Sydenham Park on the southern edge of London. As part of the development of that site, the world's first theme park was created. It was devoted to dinosaurs and other creatures of the prehistoric world. Gigantic replicas of the Iguanodon, Ichthyosaurus, Megalosaurus and other beasts were constructed and placed in and around a man-made lake. The Iguanodon was so large that on New Year's Eve, 1853, twenty-four guests had dinner in the mould used to make its huge body. The area is still called Crystal Palace today, although the glass building burned down in a terrible fire in 1936. Some of the reconstructed dinosaurs don't look quite right now, but they survived the fire and can be seen today, battered and worn, but still magnificent reminders of the past. 

当结束时，水晶宫被拆掉，挪到了伦敦南部角落的Sydenham公园，后来又得到进一步发展，成为世界第一个主题公园，其主题就是恐龙以及其他史前世界的生物。Iguanodon, Ichthyosaurus, Megalosaurus和其他野兽的巨大复制品建造了出来，放在一个人工湖的里面及周围。Iguanodon非常巨大，在1853年的新年前夜，24位客人在建造其身体的模子中共进晚餐。虽然在1936年这个玻璃建筑被一场可怕的大火烧毁，但这个区域今天仍然被称为水晶宫。有些重建的恐龙现在看起来没那么好，但却从大火中留存了下来，今天可以展览，虽然受到了损伤，但仍然是过去岁月的宏大遗留品。

We now know much more about the Age of Dinosaurs. Many different kinds have been found and we can date their ages more precisely than Mantell or Owen could. We sometimes say that they disappeared rather quickly. (Geological time is very slow, as we shall see in the next chapter.) What we mean to say is that the large dinosaurs went extinct, probably as a result of changes in the climate, after an enormous asteroid struck the earth about sixty five million years ago. But not all of them disappeared. Some of the smaller dinosaurs survived and evolved, and you can see their descendants in your garden everyday. They are called birds.

现在我们对恐龙时代知道的更多了。发现了很多种类的恐龙，也比Mantell和Owen能更精确的确定它们的年代。有时候我们说它们灭绝的很快（地质时间是很慢的，我们在下一章能看到），我们的意思是巨大的恐龙是因为气候变化才灭绝的，因为6500万年前一颗巨大的小行星撞到了地球。但它们不是全部都消失了，有的体型较小的恐龙活了下来，得到了进化，你现在可以在花园里每天都看到它们的后代，它们被称为，鸟。

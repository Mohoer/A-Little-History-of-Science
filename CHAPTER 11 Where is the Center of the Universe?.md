# CHAPTER 11 Where is the Center of the Universe?
# 第11章 宇宙的中心在哪里？

Every morning, the sun rises in the east, and every evening, it sets in the west. We can see it slowly move throughout the day, with our shadows long or short, in front or behind, depending on where the sun is. Try the experiment at midday, and see your shadow tuck up under you. Nothing could be so obvious, and since it happens every day, if you miss it today you can catch the show tomorrow.

每个早晨，太阳都会从东方升起，每个傍晚，太阳都会从西边落下。我们能看到太阳在白天缓慢运动，随着太阳位置变化，影子或短或长，在前面或后面。在中午的时候做实验看看，你的影子在你正下方。什么都不会像太阳这么明显，因为这每天都在发生，如果今天错过了，明天就可以看到。

The sun doesn't go around the earth each day, of course. You can understand how difficult it would be to convince people that what seems so obvious is not really what is going on. Put it this way: the earth is the centre of our universe, because that is where we are when we look at the sun, moon and stars. It's our centre, but not the centre.

当然，太阳并不是每天绕着地球转。要说服人们，看起来这么明显的事情并不是这么回事，这是很困难的，你应该可以理解这一点。这么说吧：地球是我们宇宙的中心，因为这是我们观察太阳、月亮和星星的时候所在的位置。这是我们的中心，但并不是宇宙的中心。

All the stargazers in the ancient world had put the earth at the centre. Remember Aristotle? After him, the most influential Greek astronomer, Ptolemy, built on the careful noting of the position of the stars night after night, season after season, and year after year. Looking at the stars on a clear night is a magical experience, and being able to identify the groups, or 'constellations', of stars is great fun. The Plough and Orion's belt are easy to trace across the sky when there are no clouds. From the Plough you can find the North Star, and this helped sailors at night to continue to sail in the right direction.

所有古代的观星者都将地球放在中心。记得亚里士多德吗？在他之后，最有影响力的希腊天文学家，托勒密，通过夜复一夜，季复一季，年复一年的仔细记录星星位置建立了一套体系。在一个清澈的夜晚观察星星是一种有魔力的经历，能识别出星座是非常有趣的。北斗七星和猎户座在没有云的夜晚是容易识别的，从北斗七星可以找到北极星，这帮助水手在夜晚沿着正确的方向继续航行。

There were problems with a model of the universe in which the earth is at the centre and the heavenly bodies move around it in perfect circles. Take the stars, for instance. They change their positions only gradually, as the nights pass. The spring equinox – when the sun is directly above the equator, making the day and night of equal length - has always been important for astronomers, and, in fact, for everyone. It occurs on either 20 or 21 March, and the 21st is the official first day of spring. The trouble is, the stars are in slightly different positions each first day of spring, which they shouldn't be if they were moving in perfect circles around the earth. Astronomers called this ‘the precession of the equinoxes’, and they had to make complicated calculations to explain why this happens.

以地球为中心，其他天体围绕地球圆周运动的宇宙模型是有问题的。以星星为例，随着夜晚来临，它们只会缓慢的改变位置。春分的时候太阳在赤道正上方，使白天和夜晚的长度相等，这对天文学家一直非常重要，对所有人都很重要。春分都是在3月20或21日，21日是春天的第一天。问题是，星星在每个春天的第一天的位置都有些许差别，如果星星绕地球做完美的圆周运动，就不会这样。天文学家称之为“岁差”，为了解释为什么会这样，需要做复杂的计算。

The movement of the planets was also a puzzle. When you simply look at the night sky with your naked eyes, the planets appear as bright stars. Ancient astronomers thought that there were seven planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, plus the sun and the moon, which they also called planets. They were obviously closer to the earth than what they called the 'fixed stars', which we call the Milky Way. Observing the planets created more problems than the fixed stars, since they do not move as if they are circling the earth. For one thing, their movement does not appear to be constant, and the planets sometimes seem to go back on themselves. To solve this problem, astronomers said that the point that the planets were spinning around was not actually at the centre of the earth. They called this point the ‘equant’, and this and other calculations helped stargazers explain what they could see in the sky at night without having to throw away the model entirely. It meant that they could still assume that the earth was at the centre of things and that the other heavenly bodies revolved around it.

行星的运动也是一个未解之谜。当只用肉眼观察夜空时，行星是明亮的星星。古代天文学家认为有七大行星：水星，金星，火星，木星和土星，加上地球和月亮，他们也称之为行星。他们比那些称之为“固定的星星”组成的银河系明显更靠近地球。观察行星产生了比固定的星星更大的问题，因为它们不像是围绕地球做圆周运动。首先，它们的运动不是恒定的，这些行星有时候看起来好像在倒退。为了解决这个问题，天文学家解释说，这些行星旋转的中心并不是地球的中心，他们称这个点为“均衡点”（想象的运行轨道），这些计算帮助了观星者解释了夜空中看到的东西，而不用整个抛弃掉这个模型。这意味着仍然还可以假设地球是宇宙的中心，其他天体围绕转动。

What would happen if instead of placing the earth at the centre of things, you put the sun there, and assumed that the planets (now including the earth as one of them) revolved around it? We are so accustomed to this view that it is hard to realize what a dramatic step it was. It went against what we see every day, it went against the teachings of Aristotle and (more importantly) of the Church, for in the Bible Joshua is said to have asked God to command the moving sun to stand still. But putting the sun at the centre of things was exactly what a Polish priest named Copernicus boldly did.

如果我们不把地球，而将太阳放在所有东西的中心，并假设行星（现在包括地球）围绕其转动，会发生什么呢？我们对这个观点太习惯了，很难意识到这一步转变是如此引人注目。这与我们每天见到的常识相违背，这与亚里士多德的说教相违背，更重要的是，这与教堂的说法相违背，因为在圣经里说，耶和华曾经请上帝命令运动的太阳静止下来。但正是一个名叫哥白尼的波兰牧师大胆的将太阳放在了宇宙的中心。

Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543} was born and died in Poland, but he studied both law and medicine in Italy. His father died when Nicholas was ten years old, so his mother's brother took charge of educating the clever young boy, at the University of Cracow, in Poland. When his uncle became Bishop of Frauenburg, also in Poland, Copernicus obtained a job at the cathedral. This gave him a secure income, enabled him to study in Italy, and when he returned, to continue his passion: studying the heavens. He built a roofless tower, where he could use his astronomical instruments. Since there were not yet any telescopes, these instruments simply allowed him to measure the angles between various heavenly bodies and the horizon, and the phases of the moon. He was also very interested in eclipses, which occur when the sun, moon, or one of the planets gets in the way of another planet and becomes partly or wholly covered from our sight.

尼古拉斯•哥白尼（1473-1543）生于波兰，去世也在波兰，但他是在意大利学习的法律和医学。他的父亲在他十岁的时候去世了，所以由他的舅舅负责这个聪明孩子的教育，在波兰的Cracow大学。当他的舅舅成为了波兰Frauenburg的主教时，哥白尼在教堂谋得一个职位。这给了他稳定的收入，使他可以在意大利学习，当他回来时，可以继续他热爱的东西：研究天空。他建造了一个没有屋顶的塔，那里他可以使用他的天文仪器。因为当时并没有望远镜，这些仪器只能用来测量众多天体与地平线之间的夹角，以及月亮的盈亏。他对日食、月食也非常感兴趣，这只在太阳和月亮，或者一个行星挡住了另一个行星，使部分或全部都看不到的情况下才会发生。

We don't know exactly when Copernicus decided that his model of the heavens and the solar system (as we now call it) was better at explaining the observations people had been making for thousands of years. But in 1514 he wrote a short manuscript and showed it to a few trusted friends. He did not dare publish it. In it, he stated quite clearly that 'the centre of the earth is not the centre of the universe', and 'we revolve around the sun like any other planet'. These were pretty definite conclusions, and during the next three decades, Copernicus quietly worked on his theory that the sun, not the earth, is at the centre of the universe. Although he spent many hours observing the heavens himself, he was at his best in thinking about what other astronomers had seen, and how their difficulties could be smoothed out by placing the sun at the centre and assuming that the planets rotated around it. Many puzzles, such as eclipses, or the strange forward and backward movement of the planets, fell into place. Besides, the sun has such an important role in human life, giving us warmth and light, that making it central was a way of recognizing that without it, life on earth would be impossible.

我们不知道哥白尼什么时候他最终认定，他关于天体和太阳系（就像我们现在称呼的）的模型可以更好的解释人们上千年来的观测结果。但在1514年他写了一份简短的手写稿，给几个值得信任的朋友看了，他不敢发表，其中他非常清楚的说到，“地球的中心并不是宇宙的中心”，以及“地球和其他行星一样围绕着太阳旋转”。这些是非常确切的结论，在接下来的三十年中，哥白尼默默的改进这个理论，太阳，而不是地球，是这个宇宙的中心。尽管他自己也花了很多时间观测天体，但他还是最擅长于思考其他天文学家的观测结果，思考如果将太阳放在中心，假设行星绕之转动，就可以解决很多解释上的困难。很多困惑，比如日食月食，或者行星奇怪的前向和后向运动，就可以逐渐被理解。另外，太阳在人类的生活中占有如此重要的地位，给我们光和热，将其放在宇宙中心，是一种承认没有太阳，地球上将不会有生命的方式。

Copernicus's model had another very significant consequence: it meant that the stars were much further away from the earth than Aristotle and other earlier thinkers had assumed. Aristotle thought that time was infinite but space was fixed. The Church had taught that time was fixed (to a few thousand years before, when God created everything), and so was space, except perhaps for Heaven itself. Copernicus accepted the Church's ideas of time and creation, but his measurements told him that the earth was much nearer to the sun than the sun was to the other stars. He also calculated the approximate distances from the sun to the planets, and of the moon from the earth. The universe was much larger than people had thought.

哥白尼的模型有另外一个显著的后果：这意味着星星的距离比亚里士多德和其他早期思想家假设的要远的多。亚里士多德认为时间是无限的，但空间是特定的。教会认为时间是特定的（开始于几千年前，当上帝创造万物时），除了上天，空间也是特定的。哥白尼接受了教会关于时间和造物的思想，但他的观测结果告诉他地球比其他星星更接近太阳。他还计算了太阳距离各行星的大致距离，以及月亮与地球的距离。宇宙比人们想象的要大的多。

Copernicus knew his research would shock people, but as he got older, he decided that he should publish his ideas. In 1542, he finished his big book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium ('Revolutions of the heavenly bodies'). But by then Copernicus was a sick old man. So he entrusted its printing to his friend, another priest called Rheticus, who knew about his ideas. Rheticus began the job, but then he had to go to work at a university in Germany, and the task was entrusted to yet another priest, Andreas Osiander. Osiander believed that Copernicus's ideas were dangerous, so he added his own introduction to this great book, which was finally printed in 1543. Here he wrote that Copernicus's ideas were not actually true, but were simply a possible way of solving some of the difficulties astronomers had long recognized with their earth-centered idea of the universe. Osiander was entitled to his own opinion, but he did a very dishonest thing: he wrote this preface as if it was the work of Copernicus himself. Since it was not signed by anybody, people assumed that this was what Copernicus meant to say about his ideas, and Copernicus was by then close to death and unable to do anything to correct the false impression that the preface gave. Consequently, for almost one hundred years, readers of this wonderful book assumed that Copernicus was merely playing around with ways to explain what you saw in the heavens each night, but not really saying that the earth went around the sun.

哥白尼知道他的研究会使人们非常震惊，但随着他变得越来越老，他决定还是要发表他的观点。在1542年，他完成了他的大作，《天理运行论》（De revolutionibus orbium coelestium）。但那时候哥白尼已经是一个带病老人，所以他委托他另一个牧师朋友，Rheticus来进行印刷，他非常了解哥白尼的思想。Rheticus开始了这项工作，但随后他必须到德国一所大学进行工作，所以这项工作被委托给另一位牧师，Andreas Osiander。Osiander认为哥白尼的观点是危险的，所以他给这部巨著写了简介，最后在1543年交付印刷。他写到，哥白尼的观点实际上并不是正确的，而只是一种可能的方法，可以解决天文学家一直以来承认的部分问题，这些问题都是地球中心论引起的。Osiander在书中加入了自己的观点，但他做了一件非常不诚实的事：他写了序言好像是哥白尼自己写的一样。因为没有任何人署名，人们就认为这都是哥白尼的观点，这时哥白尼已经接近死亡，无法做任何事纠正序言给出的错误印象。结果，在近一百年的时间里，这部著作的读者都认为哥白尼只是变着法儿解释每个夜晚都可以看到的天空的情况，而不是真的说地球是在围绕着太阳转动。

This preface made it easy for people to ignore the revolutionary message in Copernicus's book. Many people read it, however, and its comments and calculations influenced astronomy in the decades after he died. Two especially important astronomers took his work even further. One of them, Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), was inspired by Copernicus's insistence that the universe must be very large, so far away were the stars. Observing an eclipse of the sun in 1560 fired his imagination, and although his noble Danish family wanted him to study law, the only thing that really satisfied him was studying the heavens. In 1572, he noticed a new, very bright star in the night sky. He wrote about this nova stella ('new star') and argued that it showed that the heavens were not completely perfect and changeless. He built himself an elaborate observatory on an island off the coast of Denmark, and equipped it with the most advanced tools. (Alas, telescopes had still not been invented.) In 1577 he followed the path of a comet; these were generally seen as bad omens, but for Tycho, the comet's path merely signified that the heavenly bodies were not fixed in their own spheres, since the comet cut across them.

这个序言使人更容易忽略哥白尼书中革命性的观点。但很多人读了这本书，其中的注释和计算影响了他去世后数十年内的天文学家。有两个尤其重要的天文学家更进一步发展了他的工作。Tycho Brahe (1546-1601)是其中一个，哥白尼坚持认为宇宙非常宏大、星星非常遥远的观点激发了他，1560年他观测到了一次日食，这点燃了他的想象力，虽然他丹麦贵族家庭希望他学习法律，但唯一能使他感到满足的是研究天空。1572年，他注意到天空有一颗新的非常明亮的星星。他记录下了这个新星，并提出这意味着天空并不是那么完美和一直不变。他在远离丹麦海岸的小岛上建造了一个精致的观测台，装备了最先进的设备（可惜这时望远镜仍然没有发明）。1577年，他追踪了一颗彗星的路径，一般来说，这被看做不好的预兆，但对Tycho来说，彗星的路径只是意味着天体并不是固定在他们那个球体范围中，因为彗星穿过了那些球体范围。

Tycho made many important discoveries about the positions and the movements of the stars and planets, although he eventually had to close his observatory and move to Prague, where in 1597 he established a new astronomical observatory. Three years later, he made Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) his assistant. Although Tycho never accepted Copernicus's model of the sun at the centre of things, Kepler had a different outlook on the universe, and Tycho left him all his notes and manuscripts when he died in 1601. Kepler was dutiful to Tycho's memory and edited some of his work for publication, but he also took astronomy into an entirely new direction.

Tycho关于星星和行星的位置与运动有很多重要发现，但最后他仍然不得不关掉他的观测点，移居布拉格，1597年，在那新建了一个天文观测台。三年后，Johannes Kepler (1571-1630)成了他的助手。虽然Tycho从没接受哥白尼日心说的观点，但Kepler对宇宙有着不同的观点，Tycho死于1601年，将所有笔记和手稿都留给了Kepler。Kepler忠于Tycho的回忆，将其工作进行了一些编辑就发表了，但他仍然将天文学带入了一个全新的方向。

Kepler had a stormy, chaotic life. His wife and young daughter died, and his mother was put on trial for witchcraft. He himself was an intensely religious Protestant in the early days of the Reformation, when most authorities were Catholic, so he had to watch his step. He believed that the order of the heavens confirmed his own mystical appreciation of God's creation. For all that, his lasting contribution to astronomy was very hard-nosed and precise. In the midst of his writings, which are often difficult to understand, he elaborated three concepts that are still known as Kepler's Laws. They were extremely important.

Kepler的生活极其混乱。他的妻子和年轻的女儿去世了，他的母亲因为巫术受审，他自己在宗教改革早期是个极虔诚的新教徒，那时权威还基本都在罗马天主教那里，所以他必须处处小心。他相信天空的秩序验证了他自己对上帝造物的神秘信仰。尽管如此，他对天文学的永恒贡献是实际而明确的。在他晦涩的作品中，他提出了现在仍称之为Kepler定律的三个概念，这三个概念极其重要。

His first two laws were closely related, and his discovery of them was helped by the careful observations of the movements of the planet Mars that Tycho had left him. Kepler studied these for a long time before he realized that planets do not always move at the same speed; rather, they move faster when they are closer to the sun, and slower when they are further away from it. He found that if you draw a straight line from the sun (at the centre of the universe) to the planet, it is the curve of the arc made as the planet moves that is constant, not the planet's speed. This was his second law, and its consequence was his first law: that planets move not in perfect circles, but in ellipses, a kind of flattened circle. Although gravity had not yet been thought about, Kepler knew that some kind of force was acting upon the planets' movements. And he realized that the ellipse is the natural path of something revolving around a central point, as planets do around the sun. Kepler's two laws showed that the ancient idea of perfect circular motion in the heavens was wrong.

前两个定律是紧密相关的，Tycho留下的关于火星运动的认真观测结果对定律的发现有很大帮助。Kepler研究了很久，然后意识到行星的运动速度是不一样的，离太阳越近运动速度越快，离太阳越远，运动速度越慢。他发现，如果从太阳（宇宙的中心）画一条直线到行星，行星运动时单位时间内直线扫过的面积是常数，而行星的速度不是常数。这就是第二定律，进一步推导可以得到第一定律：行星运动轨迹并不是正圆形，而是椭圆，也就是扁平的圆形。虽然没有考虑过重力，但Kepler知道有某种力在影响行星的运动。他意识到椭圆是事物围绕一个中心点旋转的自然路径，就像行星绕着太阳转动一样。Kepler的前两个定律显示，古代关于天体正圆形运动的观点是错误的。

His third law was more practical: he showed that there is a special relationship between the time a planet takes to revolve completely around the sun and its average distance from the sun. This allowed astronomers to calculate the distances of the planets from the sun, and to get a sense of how large our solar system is, but also how small when compared to the enormous distances between us and the stars. Luckily, at around the same time a scientific instrument was invented to help us look further into those distances. The man who turned the telescope into a tool of immense power was the most famous astronomer of all: Galileo Galilei.

他的第三定律更加实用：他说在行星围绕太阳运动一周的时间，和行星与太阳的平均距离之间，有一种特殊的关系。这使得天文学家可以计算行星与太阳之间的距离，得到太阳系到底有多大的感觉，以及与我们与星星之间的距离相比时，这是多么的渺小。幸运的是，在大约相同的时间里，发明了一种科学仪器帮助我们望向更远的距离。发明望远镜这种强大工具的，就是最著名的天文学家：伽利略。

# CHAPTER 15 The 'New Chemistry'
# 第15章 新化学

If you have a chemistry set then you may already know about litmus paper. These small strips of special paper can tell you whether a solution is acid or alkaline. If you stir some vinegar in water (making it acidic) and dip in the blue paper, it will turn red. If you try it with bleach (which is alkaline), the red paper will turn blue. Next time you use a piece of litmus paper, think of Robert Boyle, for he created the test more than 300 years ago.

如果你有一套化学设备，你可能已经知道石蕊试纸。这些小条状的特殊的纸可以告诉你溶液是酸性还是碱性的。如果你在水中倒入一些醋（会使其变成酸性），将蓝色试纸放入，它会变红。如果放入一些漂白剂（碱性的），红色试纸会变成蓝色的。下次你用这种石蕊试纸时，想想Robert Boyle，因为他在300多年前创造出了这套检验方法。

Boyle (1627-91) was born into a large aristocratic family in Ireland. He was the youngest son, and never had to worry about money. Unlike a lot of wealthy people, Boyle was always generous with his fortune, and he donated a good deal of it to charity. He paid for the Bible to be translated into an American Indian language. Religion and science played equally big parts in his life.

波义耳Boyle（1627-91）生于爱尔兰一个大贵族家庭。他是最小的儿子，从没有为钱担心过。和很多有钱人不同，Boyle一直非常慷慨，为慈善捐献了很多财产。他付钱使圣经翻译成一种美洲印第安语言。宗教和科学在他生命中同等重要。

He spent a few years at Eton, the elite English school, and then traveled in Europe, where he had a series of private tutors. Boyle returned to England where the Civil War was raging; some of his family sided with King Charles I, and some with the Parliamentarians, who sought to overthrow the king and establish a republic. His sister convinced him to join the Parliamentarians, and through her, he met an enthusiastic social, political and scientific reformer called Samuel Hartlib. Like Francis Bacon, Hartlib believed that science had the power to improve the lives of human beings, and convinced the young Boyle that studying agriculture and medicine could lead to such improvements. Boyle began with medicine and looked at the cures for various diseases, gaining along the way a lifelong fascination with chemistry.

他在Eton度过了几年时光，在一所英语精英学校，然后旅行到欧洲，那里他有一系列私人导师。Boyle回到英国，那里正在发生内战，他的家庭中有人站在国王查理一世一边，有人站在国会一边，当时国会正在试图推翻国王，建立共和国。他的姐姐说服他加入了国会一方，通过他姐姐，他遇到了一个狂热的社会、政治和科学改革家，名叫Samuel Hartlib。和培根一样，Hartlib相信科学可以改进人类的生活，并说服了Boyle学习农学和医学可以得到这样的改进。Boyle从医学开始，学习了很多疾病的治疗方法，然后一生都沉迷在化学里。

Some religious people fear exposing themselves or their children to new ideas because they think the ideas might undermine their faith. Robert Boyle was not one of these people: his religious belief was so secure that he read whatever was related to his wide scientific interests. Descartes and Galileo were controversial figures in Boyle's early days, but he studied them both carefully - he read Galileo's Starry Messenger in 1642 in Florence, the very same year and place in which Galileo died - and used their insights in his own work. Boyle was also interested in the atomists of ancient times (Chapter 3), though he was not altogether convinced by their belief that the universe consists of nothing but ‘atoms and the void’. He knew, however, that there were some basic units of matter in the universe, which he called ‘corpuscles’, but he could go about his work without the godless (atheistic) associations of ancient Greek atomism.

一些宗教人士不愿意他们自己或儿女接触新思想，因为他们认为那会渐渐破坏他们的信仰。Robert Boyle不是这种人，他的宗教信仰非常安全，他的科学兴趣也很广博，他不断阅读着各种相关的东西。笛卡尔和伽利略在Boyle早期的岁月里都是有争议的人物，但他仔细了研究了他们，他1642年在佛罗伦萨读了伽利略的《星际信使》，那一年伽利略在那里去世，将他们的深刻见解用在他自己的工作中。Boyle还对那些古代的原子论者（见第三章）非常感兴趣，原子论者认为宇宙仅仅是由“原子和虚空”组成，Boyle并不完全信服这个观点。但他知道，宇宙中有一些物质的基本单位，他称之为“微粒”，但他可以在不受那些无神论的古希腊原子论者的影响下着手开始自己的工作，

Boyle was equally unsatisfied with Aristotle's theory of the four elements - air, earth, fire and water - and he showed by experiment that it was not correct. He burnt a stick of fresh wood and showed that the smoke that came off it was not air. Nor was the fluid that oozed out of the end of the burning wood ordinary water. The flame differed depending on what was burnt, so that was not pure fire, and the ash that was left was not earth. By carefully analyzing the results of these simple experiments, Boyle did enough to show that something as common as wood was not made of air, earth, fire and water. He also pointed out that some substances, like gold, could not be broken down further. When heated, gold melted and ran but it didn't change like wood did when it was burnt: when gold grew cold, it returned to its original form. Boyle recognized that the things that surround us in our daily lives, such as wooden tables and chairs, and woolen dresses and hats, were made up of a variety of components, but they could not be reduced to the four Greek elements, or to the three elements of Paracelsus. Some believe that Boyle came up with the modern definition of a chemical element. He certainly came close when he described elements as things ‘not being made of other bodies, or of one another’. But he didn't take this any further, nor did he use it in his own chemical experiments.

Boyle同样对亚里士多德的四元素（气，土，火，水）论不满意，他通过实验说明了这是错误的。他燃烧了一支新鲜的木棍，说明了燃烧出的烟雾并不是空气；燃烧木材后端渗出的液体也并不是普通的水。燃烧的物体不一样，火焰也不一样所以那并不纯粹是火，燃烧后得到的灰烬也不是土。通过仔细分析这些简单实验的结果，Boyle足以证明就像木材这样简单的东西也不是由气、土、火和水组成的。他还指出有些物质，比如黄金，不能进一步被分解。当加热的时候，黄金会熔化，并流动，但并不会像木材燃烧那样变化，当黄金冷却，又回重新变回原来的样子。Boyle认为我们日常生活周围的事物，比如木桌木椅，羊毛衣物和帽子，都是由很多种成分组成的，但它们不会分解成那四种希腊元素，也不会分解成那三种Paracelsus元素。有些人认为Boyle提出了化学元素的现代定义，当他定义元素为“不是由其他实体组成的，或者互相组成”时，确实是比较接近的，但他并没有更进一步，也没有在自己的化学实验中使用这些定义。

Instead, Boyle's notion of the 'corpuscle' as a unit of matter suited his experimental purposes very well. Boyle was a tireless experimenter, spending hours in his private laboratory either alone or with friends, and writing up his experiments in great detail in books. It is partly this attention to detail that makes Boyle so special in the history of science. He and his friends wanted science to be open and public, and for others to be able to use the knowledge they gained. No longer was it enough to claim to have found out some deep secret of nature, as Paracelsus had done. A scientist needed to be able to demonstrate that deep secret to others, either in person or through written descriptions.

反而是Boyle“微粒”作为物质基本单位的概念很适合他的实验目的。Boyle是一个不知疲倦实验者，经常在独自或和朋友在实验室中一待就是几个小时，并在书中详细记录他的实验细节。Boyle对实验细节的关注，也是他在科学史上如此特殊的部分原因。他和他的朋友希望科学做到开放公开，这样别人也可以用到他们发现的知识。仅仅声明发现了一些自然深处的秘密，就像Paracelsus做的那样，这是不够的，科学家需要将这些秘密展示给其他人，要么亲自展示，要么通过书面记录。

This insistence on openness was one of the guiding rules in the scientific circles in which Boyle moved. The first of these was an informal group in Oxford, where he lived in the 1650s; when most of the group moved to London, they joined with others to establish what became, in 1662, the Royal Society of London, still one of the leading scientific societies in the world. They knew that they were doing something that Francis Bacon had called for half a century earlier. Boyle was a leading light in this club devoted to increasing knowledge. From the beginning, the Fellows - as the Royal Society's members were called - were keen that the new knowledge they uncovered and discussed at their meetings should be useful.

这种对开放的坚持是Boyle进入的科学圈的指导原则。牛津的一个非正式团体是第一个这种例子，这正是在Boyle生活的17世纪50年代，也是在他生活的城市牛津；当大多数这种团体都移到伦敦后，它们一起成立了大的团体，后来在1662年成为了伦敦皇家协会，现在仍然是世界主要科学团体之一。他们知道他们正在做培根半个世纪前呼吁的事。Boyle是这个俱乐部的指路明灯，致力于丰富知识。从最开始，皇家协会会员就非常渴望他们发现和在会议上讨论的知识会成为有用的知识。

One of Boyle's favorite collaborators was another Robert, a few years younger than him: Robert Hooke (1635-1702). Hooke was even cleverer than Boyle, but unlike Boyle, he came from a poor family. He always had to earn his way in life by his wits. Hooke was employed by the Royal Society to perform experiments at each of its meetings. He became very skilled at inventing and handling all kinds of scientific equipment. Hooke devised many experiments; for example, to measure the speed of sound, or to examine what happens when blood is transfused from one dog to another. In some cases the dog that had been given new blood seemed more energetic, and the men were encouraged to experiment with humans. They transfused blood from a lamb into a human being, but it didn't work; in Paris, too, one person who had been given a transfusion died, so these experiments were given up. Hooke's task at the Royal Society's weekly meetings was to prepare two or three less deadly experiments to entertain and stimulate the Fellows.

Boyle最喜欢的一个合作者是比他年轻几岁的Robert Hooke(1635-1702)，Hooke比Boyle还要聪明，但和Boyle不一样的是，他的家里比较贫穷，他一直要依靠自己的智慧赚钱生活。皇家协会雇佣他在各种会议上完成实验，他逐渐非常善于发明和处理各种科学仪器，Hooke设计了很多实验，比如测量声音的速度，或者当一条狗的血液被输入到另一条狗身上会发生什么，有几次输了新鲜血液的狗看起来更有活力，这鼓励了人们对人进行实验，他们将羊血输入到人体内，但没有作用，有一个人在巴黎进行了输血而且死掉了，所以这类实验最后放弃了。Hooke在皇家协会每周会议上的任务就是准备两到三个没那么致命的实验，娱乐或激励这些会员。

Hooke was one of the earliest 'savants' to make good use of the microscope. (A 'savant' literally means 'one who knows', and the term was often used to describe what we would now call scientists.) He used his microscope to reveal a new world of things invisible to the naked eye, uncovering structures in plants, animals and other objects that could never be seen without using it. The fellows loved to peer through the microscope at their meetings, and in addition to Hooke's demonstrations, they also received many communications from another famous early microscopist, a Dutchman named Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Leeuwenhoek worked as a cloth merchant, but in his spare time he ground and polished very small lenses that could magnify things more than 200 times. He had to make a new lens for each observation, and crafted hundreds during his long life. He would place each lens in a metal holder with the small object that he wanted to examine behind it. He found tiny organisms in pond water, bacteria in the scrapings of his teeth and many other wondrous things. Hooke too believed that his microscope could take the observer closer to nature, and the illustrations in his book, Micrographia, published in 1665 (the very year of the London plague), caused a sensation. Many of these illustrations look odd to us, for they show very large, magnified insects, such as flies or lice, and these pictures have become quite famous. Yet he also filled his book with observations and speculations on the structures and functions of other things he could see through his microscope. He showed one picture of a thin section of cork, from the cork tree - the material used to close wine bottles. He called the little boxy structures he saw there ‘cells’. They weren't actually what we now call cells, but the name stuck.

Hooke是最早充分使用显微镜的专家之一。他用显微镜展示了一个肉眼看不到的新世界，揭示了植物、动物和其他物体的结构，如果不用显微镜，则永远也不会看到。会员们喜欢在会议上透过显微镜窥视，作为Hooke演示的补充，他们还收到了很多另一位著名的早期显微镜专家的通信，他是一位荷兰人，名叫Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723)。Leeuwenhoek是一位布商，但在业余时间他打磨出了非常小的透镜，可以放大200倍以上。他每次观测都制作新透镜，所以他一生制作了数百个镜片。他将每个镜头都放在金属支撑物上，待检查的小物体放在镜头后面。他在池塘水里发现了微生物，他牙齿刮下来的碎屑里发现了细菌，以及其他很多奇妙的东西。Hooke也相信他的显微镜会使观察者更接近自然，他1665年（伦敦大瘟疫那一年）出版的书《微物图志》中的插图引起了一阵轰动。很多这些插图看起来非常古怪，因为他们展示的是放大倍数很高的昆虫，比如苍蝇或虱子，这些图片变得非常有名。他的书中还包括了对其他事物结构和功能的观察和推测，当然都是可以放在显微镜下观察的事物。他展示了一张软木薄片的图片，就是塞住红酒瓶的材料，他将看到的小小的盒子状的结构称为“细胞”，实际上不是现在我们所说的细胞，但名字沿用了下来。

Both Boyle and Hooke had a favorite mechanical device: their version of the air pump. Hooke and Boyle's air pump worked in the same way as the pumps we use to put air into bicycle tires or footballs. It had a large central cavity, with a tight fitting that could be opened at the top, and another opening in the bottom, where there was a valve through which gases could be drawn in or let out. It might not seem very exciting, but it helped solve one of the major puzzles of science during the period: whether it was possible to have a vacuum, that is, completely empty space, not even containing air. Descartes had insisted that vacuums were impossible ('Nature abhors a vacuum' was the common phrase expressing this idea). But if, as Boyle had argued, matter was ultimately composed of separate corpuscles, in different forms, there ought to be some space between them. If something like water is heated, so that it evaporates and turns into a gas, the same corpuscles would still be there, said Boyle, but the gas occupies more space than the liquid had done. After lots of experiments heating liquids to gases, he saw that all gases behaved pretty much the same when they were in the air pump. Boyle and Hooke came to a conclusion that is still known as Boyle's Law. At a constant temperature, the volume that any gas occupies has a special mathematical relationship to the pressure that it is under. We say that its volume is directly influenced by the pressure around it. So, if you increase the pressure by decreasing the space it occupies, the gas squeezes into the available space. (If you increase the temperature, the gas expands, and a new pressure comes into effect, but it's the same basic principle.) In the future, Boyle's Law would help the development of the steam engine, so remember him when we get there.

Boyle和Hooke两个人都非常喜爱一种机械装置，是当时的一种气泵。Hooke和Boyle的气泵和现在给自行车胎或足球打气的气泵原理是一样的，包括一个大的中央腔洞，上面有一个可以开口的密封装置，底部有一个开口，开口处有一个阀门，通过阀门可以吸入或放出空气。这可能不是多激动人心，但确实帮助解决了当时一个主要的科学疑惑：可能会有真空吗，也就是完全空的空间，甚至没有空气。笛卡尔坚持认为真空是不可能的，但Boyle争辩到，物质最终是由单独的微粒以不同形式构成的，微粒中间肯定是有一些空间的。如果加热像水这种物质，使其蒸发成为气体，仍然是那些微粒，但占据的空间就比液体时大了很多。他做了很多加热液体成为气体的实验，发现气体在气泵里的行为是很类似的。Boyle和Hooke得到了结论，现在称之为Boyle定律，在恒定的温度下，任何气体所占据的空间与气压有一定关系，也就是说气体体积与气压是直接相关的。所以，如果增加气压，那么气体就会被压缩（如果增加温度，气体膨胀，就会产生新的气压，但基本原则是一样的）。在未来，Boyle定律会帮助产生蒸汽机，所以当我们叙述到那里的时候，要记得他。

Boyle and Hooke used their air pump to examine the characteristics of many gases, including the 'air' that we breathe. Air was, remember, one of the Ancients' elements, but it was becoming clear to many people in the seventeenth century that the air that surrounds us and keeps us alive is not a simple substance. It was obviously involved in breathing, since we draw air into our lungs when we take a breath. But what else did it do? Boyle and Hooke, both individually and together, were very interested in what happens when a piece of wood or charcoal burns. They also wondered why blood was dark red before it went into the lungs and bright red when it came out of them. Hooke linked these two questions together and suggested that what happens in the lungs is a special kind of combustion, with the 'air' being the substance that connected both the breathing and the burning. Hooke pretty much left it at that, but the problems surrounding both the composition and nature of 'air', as well as what happens during respiration (breathing) and combustion, continued to intrigue scientists for more than a century after Boyle and Hooke, as people repeated and developed their experiments.

Boyle和Hooke使用气泵检验了很多气体的性质，包括我们呼吸的空气。气最初是古人认为的元素之一，但对于17世纪的人来说，越来越清楚的是，我们呼吸的周围的空气并不是一种简单的物质。这肯定与呼吸有关，因为我们呼吸的时候肺部会吸入空气。但还有其他什么？Boyle和Hooke都各自而又同时对木头或木炭燃烧时发生的事情非常感兴趣，他们还想知道血液进入肺部之前为什么是暗红色的，从肺部出来后为什么是鲜红色的。Hooke将这两个问题结合起来，认为在肺部发生的是一种特殊的燃烧，因为空气是连接呼吸与燃烧的物质。Hooke的解释基本上就是这样，但围绕空气的组成和性质的问题，和呼吸与燃烧的问题，在Boyle和Hooke以后一百多年里持续激起科学家的兴趣，人们不断重复和发展他们的实验。

There was hardly any area of science that Robert Hooke did not think about. He invented a watch run by a set of springs (a great improvement in time-keeping), wondered about the origin of fossils, and investigated the nature of light. He also had brilliant things to say about a problem we have encountered before, and will look at in more detail in the next chapter: the physics of movement and force. Hooke was investigating these subjects at the same time as Isaac Newton. As we shall see, Newton himself is one of the reasons that everybody has heard of Sir Isaac, but few people know about Mr Hooke.

几乎没有Hooke没思考过的科学领域。他发明了一种表，由一套弹簧驱动（计时方面的重大改进），怀疑过化石的来源，研究过光的性质。他对于我们讨论过的一个问题也有更新的见解，我们将在下一章中讨论更多的细节：运动与受力的物理原理。Hooke与牛顿是同时在研究这些主题的。就像我们要看到的一样，我们都知道牛顿，但很少有人知道Hooke先生。

# CHAPTER 35 Where Did We Come From
# 第35章 我们从哪里来

Today we know that we share 98 per cent of our genome with our closest animal relatives, the chimpanzees. That's an awful lot of similarity, but there are some crucial differences. While chimps do communicate they don't talk together as humans do. And we can read and write. Take a step back and we find that humans and chimpanzees, together with the gorillas and orang-utans, make up the family of Hominidae, often known as the ‘great apes’. We humans are less closely related to gorillas and orang-utans, but at some point in the past all four of these groups shared a common ancestor, from which each group evolved. That was a long time ago, perhaps fifteen million years.

今天我们知道我们的基因组和最接近的动物亲戚-黑猩猩-98%都是相同的。这真是非常大的相似性，但还是有重要的区别。虽然黑猩猩也有交流，但它们不会像人类一样一起谈话，而且我们还会读和写。退一步来看，我们发现人类和黑猩猩，还有大猩猩及猩猩，组成了人科这个家族，也叫“类人猿”。我们和大猩猩、猩猩的相似性没那么多，但在过去的某个时候，这四个种群都有共同的祖先，从这个祖先发展出了四个群体。那个时代非常久远，可能是1500万年前。

We find our great-ape 'cousins' fascinating and slightly disturbing. Those who wrote about them and studied them in the past did so too. They wondered where this brute animal, that seemed so like us and yet so different, fitted into creation. In 1699 an English anatomist, Edward Tyson (1651-1708), obtained the body of a dead chimpanzee. He carefully dissected this exotic animal and compared what he found with what he knew of human anatomy. It was the first time anyone had looked so closely at a chimpanzee. Tyson slotted it into Aristotle's Great Chain of Being - just below us. It was natural, he argued, that some animal would smooth over the gap between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. He didn't say it, but Tyson had suggested the need for a 'missing link' in the chain, something that connects us to other animals.

我们发现这些类人猿表亲非常令人着迷，同时还有点让人不安。过去那些研究和写作它们的人也有同样的感觉。它们和我们这么接近同时又那么不同，他们怀疑这些残忍的野兽是怎么创造出来的。1699年一个英国解剖学家，Edward Tyson（1651-1708），得到了一具黑猩猩的尸体。他小心的解剖了这个奇特的动物，然后和他所知道的人类解剖学知识进行了比较。这是第一次有人如此接近的对黑猩猩进行观察。Tyson将其置入了亚里士多德的“伟大的存在之链”，并且就在人类的下面。他说，这是非常自然的，某种动物会填补人和其他动物的缺口。虽然他没有说，但Tyson曾经认为存在之链中需要有些东西连接人类和其他动物。

In Britain, Germany and France, a growing number of human artifacts such as flint arrows and axe heads were being uncovered. This was exciting evidence of human presence going back millennia. These tools were often found in caves and fossil sites among the fossilized remains of extinct animals - the fearsome sabre-tooth tigers and giant woolly mammoths. These extinct animals and the Stone Age humans who had made the tools had obviously been alive at the same time. Humans had been on the earth for tens of thousands of years . . . not the much shorter period that most people believed. Not everyone agreed, of course, but Darwin's friend Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-95) had no doubts. Huxley was excited by the discovery in 1856 of 'Neanderthal man' in a cave in the Neander Valley in Germany. He wrote about this fossil, and about modern humans and the great apes in his book Man's Place in Nature (1863). We know now that this was the first fossil hominin that did not belong to our species, Homo sapiens, the biological name that Linnaeus gave us (Chapter 19). Hominin is the name now used for ourselves and for our extinct ancestors, and as more fossil evidence is uncovered, the group gets larger. The tree of life is growing, and gradually being filled in.

在英国、德国和法国，出土了越来越多的人造物品如燧石箭头和斧头。这是数千年前人类存在的证据，非常令人兴奋。这些工具通常在洞穴或灭绝动物的化石残留处被发现，比如可怕的剑齿虎和多毛的猛犸象。这些灭绝的动物和制造这些工具的石器时代人类显然生存在同一个时期。人类在这个地球上已经存在了上万年，而大多数人觉得这个时期短的多。当然，并不是所有的人都同意，但达尔文的朋友Thomas Henry Huxley（1825-95）深信不疑。Huxley对1856年在德国尼安德谷发现的尼安德特人非常兴奋。关于这些化石，还有现代人类和类人猿，他写了一本著作《人类在自然界中的位置》（1863）。我们现在知道这是第一种不属于我们智人（Linnaeus给人类取的生物学名字，见第19章）这个物种的人科化石。人科是用于我们和我们灭绝的祖先的名字，随着出土的化石越来越多，我们的祖先也越来越多。生命之树在成长，逐渐丰满。

At the time, Huxley was cautious enough to recognize that a single find doesn't tell you everything about a whole species, and so he kept Neanderthal man in the same species as modern humans. But he was confident that this was a very old specimen, one that had been around long enough for evolution to have taken place. There had certainly been some changes, for although Neanderthal man was similar enough to us, he was also different. The skull had immense brow ridges and a much larger cavity for the nose. The proportions of the limbs and body were different to ours. It was even possible that this was a deformed body rather than another species. In time we would learn that the Neanderthals were the first hominins to bury their dead.

在那个时候，Huxley非常小心的承认，单独一个发现并不能给出一个物种所有的信息，所以他将尼安德特人归入我们现代人类这个物种。但他非常确定，这是个非常古老的样本，他们存在的时间非常长，足够使他们产生进化。虽然尼安德特人和我们很像，但仍然还是有差别的，所以肯定有一些变化。其头骨的眉脊非常宽大，鼻腔也大的多。四肢与身体的比例和我们和不同。甚至还可能这只是个畸形的身体，而不是另一个物种。随着时间过去，我们还知道尼安德特人是第一个会埋葬死者的人科动物。

Huxley knew all about Darwin's ideas on human evolution before the great man published two books in quick succession laying out his ideas and evidence for our ancestry. In 1871 The Descent of Man did what Darwin had avoided doing in On the Origin of Species: it focused his compelling account of our world upon the human race. In 1872, his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, added an important psychological dimension to his argument. He based the book on his careful watching of his own children, their smiles and grimaces, among many other behaviors. Humans were part of life on earth, like all the other species of plants and animals. Darwin concluded that our ancestors had probably lived in Africa, where humans had first evolved.

Huxley先知道了达尔文关于人类进化的思想，然后接连出版了两本书，阐述自己关于人类祖先的思想和证据。1871年，《人类的血统》做了达尔文在《物种起源》中避免的事情：给出了关于人类种族的令人信服的解释。1872年，《人类和动物的表情解释》出版，给他的论点加入了重要的心理学解释。他的书的基础在于他仔细观察了他自己孩子的笑脸和痛苦的表情，以及其他的行为。和其他所有植物和动物物种一样，人类是地球生命的一部分。达尔文得出结论，我们的祖先很可能生活在非洲，人类首先在那里得到进化。

Darwin's depiction of evolution as a 'tree of life' meant that we could not be descended from modern apes. But it was the 'ape man' connection that immediately caught the public's imagination. His ideas on evolution were first debated in public at a crowded meeting in Oxford, organized by the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The Association aimed to bring the latest scientific knowledge to everyone and held a meeting every year where scientists talked and debated what was new. The meeting in 1860 was full of drama, so sensational was the 'ape man' idea. The discussion of Darwin's ideas on evolution was eagerly awaited, with Bishop Samuel Wilberforce leading the anti-Darwinians and Huxley the pro-Darwinians. Wilberforce, thinking he was clever, asked Huxley whether he was descended from the apes on his grandfather's or his grandmother's side. Huxley replied that he would indeed rather be descended from an ape than waste his time and brain on such a silly question: Wilberforce had quite missed the point. Wilberforce remained unconvinced, but Huxley and evolution came out on top that day.

达尔文关于进化的叙述“生命之树”意思是我们不太可能是从现代猿类进化出来的。但“猿人”的联系迅速抓住了公众的注意力。他关于进化的论点的第一次辩论是在牛津的一个拥挤的集会上，由英国科学进步协会组织的。协会的目标是将最新的科学知识带给每个人，并每年举办集会让科学家对最新进展进行辩论。1860年的集会非常有戏剧性，“猿人”的观点非常轰动。大家都很期待关于达尔文进化论的辩论，Huxley作为支持达尔文论点的一方，Samuel Wilberforce主教作为反对达尔文观点的另一方。Wilberforce觉得他自己非常聪明，问Huxley是从他祖父还是祖母哪一方的猿类中遗传下来的。Huxley回答说他宁愿从一个浪费自己的时间和精力在这样一个愚蠢的问题的猿类遗传下来：Wilberforce失败了。Wilberforce没有被说服，但Huxley和进化论的观点那一天胜出了。

The discoveries of mankind's long existence on the earth encouraged naturalists, anthropologists (who study humankind) and archaeologists to ask the question: What had been the original condition of human beings? 'Cave men' emerged in this period from the discoveries in caves in Britain and Europe. It was clear that these cave dwellers had used fire. Weapons, stone tools and cooking utensils were all found. Anthropologists and explorers also discovered hunter-gatherer groups in Africa, Asia and South America, and suggested that all human societies had passed through common stages of social development. E.B.Tylor (1832-1917) became the first professor of anthropology at Oxford. He used an idea of 'survivals' to put forward a grand path of human social and cultural evolution. By this he meant social and religious practices, superstitions and different ways of organizing family relationships. According to Tylor, these survivals were frozen in the 'primitive' people of Africa, for instance, and gave clues to the common past of humankind. Tylor and others wanted to understand the origins of language and looked at gestures and other ways of communicating.

很久之前人类就在地球上存在的这个发现，促使博物学家、人类学家（研究人类）和考古学家提出这个问题：最初人类的生存环境是怎样的？随着英国和欧洲很多洞穴的发现，穴居人的概念这个时候被提了出来。很清楚，这些穴居人使用了火，还找到了武器、石质工具和食物器皿。人类学家和探险家还在非洲、亚洲和南美洲发现了猎人-采集者群体，于是认为所有人类社会都在社会发展的过程中都经历过这一共同阶段。E.B. Tylor (1832-1917)在牛津成为第一个人类学教授。他使用“残存文化特征（survivals）”的概念来研究人类社会和文化特征进化，通过这个他研究的是社会和宗教实践、迷信和不同的组织家庭关系的方法。举个例子，根据Tylor的理论，这些残存文化特征凝结在非洲的原始人类中，这就给研究人类共同的过去提供了线索。Tylor和其他人想理解语言的起源，他们开始研究手势和其他交流的方法。

This early anthropology contrasted a dynamic Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand with the presumed unchanging lives of 'primitive' peoples, or even the long-established and complex cultures of India and China. We now see it as arrogant. Applied to Western society, the idea of evolutionary competition and struggle seemed to explain why some individuals prospered and some didn't. As industrial capitalism gained strength, 'social Darwinism' - evolution applied to human culture- began to be used to explain why some people were rich and others were poor, and some nations powerful and others not. Social Darwinism justified the triumph of strong individuals, races or nations over weaker ones.

这种早期的人类学动态的对比欧洲、北美、澳大利亚和新西兰的假定不变的原始人的生活，甚至与印度和中国长期固定下来的复杂文化对比。我们现在觉得这非常自大。在西方社会中，进化的竞争和奋斗似乎可以解释为什么有的人成功了，而有的人没有成功。当工业资本主义开始发力，社会达尔文主义（进化论在人类文化中的应用）开始被用来解释为什么有的人富，有的人穷，有的国家强盛，而有的国家则不。社会达尔文主义使强壮的个人、种族或国家对较弱的胜利有了正当理由。

While some people were debating social Darwinism, others were discussing biological evolution. Until the 1890s, all the fossilized human remains that were discovered were considered to be Homo sapiens. The status of Neanderthal man remained uncertain. Then, a Dutch anthropologist, Eugene Dubois (1858-1940) went to the Dutch East Indies, looking for evidence of human evolution in the land of the orang-utan. In Java (now Indonesia), he found the top of a fossilized skull belonging to a non-human creature that had walked upright. He called the creature 'Java man'. Attention turned to Asia, as the place where humans must have evolved. Java man, along with another old human skeleton found in France at Cro-Magnan, stimulated questions about what had happened first. Was it walking upright, on two legs? Or a large brain? Or language and living in societies?

当一些人争论社会达尔文主义的时候，其他人则在讨论生物进化。直到1890年，所有发现的人类骸骨化石都被认为是智人。尼安德特人的状态尚未确定。接着，一个荷兰人类学家，Eugene Dubois（1858-1940），去荷兰西印度群岛的猩猩之地寻找人类进化的证据。在爪哇（现在印度尼西亚）他找到了一种直立行走的非人类生物的头盖骨化石。他将这种叫做“爪哇人”。于是注意力转到了亚洲这个人类肯定曾经进化的地方。爪哇人，和另一种在法国Cro-Magnan发现的古人类骨架，提出了最早发生了什么的问题。是双腿直立行走？或脑容量变大？还是语言和社会生活？

There have been many more discoveries of pre-human hominins in Asia. But in the twentieth century, it was Africa that proved how shrewd Darwin's prediction had been. In 1924, a fossil was discovered by the Australian anatomist Raymond Dart(1893-1988). It became known as the ‘Taung child’ and its significance was championed by the South African doctor Robert Broom (1866-1951). Tuang child had teeth like a human child but its brain was too ape-like to be considered human. Broom believed that Dart's fossil (and several more found subsequently, including an adult) was an ancient ancestor of human beings. Dart named it Australopithecus africanus, literally, the ‘southern ape of Africa’. We now think it is between 2.4 million and 3 million years old. After Taung child, Africa yielded many other important fossils, helping piece together man's evolutionary ancestry. Louis and Mary Leakey (1903-72;1913-96) made the human story even more famous. They were working in the 1950s mainly in Olduvai Gorge in Kenya, and Louis Leakey stressed that early hominins were tool-makers. He called one of the fossil hominins that had lived 1.6 to 2.4 million years ago Homo habilis - the ‘handyman’. Mary Leakey discovered in the 1970s some footprints that were 3.6 million years old, preserved in volcanic ash that had hardened. The footprints were of three upright hominins, along with other animals, and suggested that walking on two feet came first, before hominins evolved with a big brain.

在亚洲有过很多前人类hominin的发现。但在20世纪，是在非洲最终证明了达尔文的预言是多么机智。在1924年，澳大利亚人类学家Raymond Dart（1893-1988）发现了一具化石，后来这具化石被称为“汤恩幼儿”，其重要性为南非医生Robert Broom（1866-1951）所证实。汤恩幼儿具有人类的牙齿，但其大脑与猿类非常接近，而不像人类大脑。Broom相信Dart化石（后续又发现了几具，包括一个成人的）是人类的古代祖先。Dart命名其为“Australopithecus africanus”，意为非洲南方古猿。现在我们认为其在240万到300万前左右。汤恩幼儿后，非洲发现了更多其他的重要化石，帮助建立了人类进化的血统历史。Louis和Mary Leakey(1903-72;1913-96)使这个人类故事更加出名。50年代，他们主要在肯尼亚的Olduvai George工作，Louis Leakey强调早期的hominin是工具制造者。他称一族160万到240万年前的hominin化石“能人”。Mary Leakey在70年代发现有些脚印是360万年前的，这些脚印保存在硬化的火山灰中。这些脚印是3个直立的hominin的，同时还有其他动物的，这说明双脚直立行走最先发生，然后进化出一个较大的大脑。

For the first half of the twentieth century, the study of human fossil bones was complicated by some curious finds in a gravel pit in the village of Piltdown, East Sussex, in southern England. The discoveries began in 1908. Then in 1912 a local amateur archaeologist, Charles Dawson (1864-1916), announced the recovery of a skull at Piltdown. The find generated tremendous excitement. 'Piltdown man' had a modern-looking human skull with a jawbone that was ape-like. It looked like a real missing link, a kind of ‘ape man’. A number of eminent scientists published papers on the strange fossil. But it was difficult to fit it into the emerging sequence of the new hominin and ancient ape fossils. Piltdown had always seemed fishy, and in the early 1950s dating techniques that had not been available in 1908 proved that it had been a huge forgery. Piltdown man combined a modern human skull with the jaw of an orang-utan, soaked in chemicals to make them look old. The teeth had also been filed down. No one is sure 'whodunnit' - there are several suspects but no definitive conviction. Dawson himself is high on the list of suspects.

20世纪前半，在英国南部Sussex郡东部Piltdown村的一个沙砾坑有了一些奇怪的发现，这使得人类遗骨化石的研究变得复杂起来，这项发现开始于1908年。接着在1912年，一个当地的业余考古学家，Charles Dawson（1864-1916），宣称在Piltdown复原了一个头骨，这激起了人们巨大的兴趣。Piltdown人有着现代人外貌的头骨，但下颚骨与猿类相似，这看起来非常像那个缺失的链条，一种“猿人”。几个著名科学家就这个奇怪的化石发表了论文，但很难将其放入从古猿类化石到新hominin的序列中。Piltdown看起来非常可疑，随后在50年代的时候，最新的技术（1908年时还没有的技术）证明这是一个巨大的伪造。Piltdown人将人类头骨和猩猩下颚拼接了起来，并浸泡在化学物质中使其看起来很古老。牙齿也经过了锉平。没人确定到底是谁做了这件事，有几个可疑人员，但没有确切证据。Dawson在可疑人员中最具有嫌疑。

With Piltdown revealed as a hoax, the other fossil hominins could be placed in a more likely order, using radiometric dating to learn their age, and comparing their physical characteristics. One fossil in particular, nicknamed Lucy, has become a celebrity, going on tour and having her 'biography' written. Lucy was uncovered in Ethiopia in 1978, and her skeleton was more than half complete. She had lived some three to four million years ago, long before the Taung child. Like the Tuang child, she is of the genus Australopithecus but is an earlier species, afarensis - 'ape of Afar'. Lucy's legs, pelvis and feet mean she could probably have walked upright and climbed in trees or on rocks. Her brain cavity was not much bigger than a modern chimpanzee's, but her brain was larger than a chimp's, in relation to the size of her body. (The brain-to-body ratio is a better guide to mental functions than mere size: elephants have larger brains than humans, but smaller brain-body ratios. There are of course many other factors to 'intelligence' than simply brain size.) Lucy really did show 'mixed' characteristics, not yet even crudely 'human', but a successful creature in her own right.

Piltdown被证明是个骗局后，对其他hominin化石用放射技术确定它们的年代，并比较其物理性质，终于可以将其排列为一个合适的顺序。其中一个特殊的化石，名为Lucy，成为了其中的明星，进行了巡回展出，并有人写了传记。Lucy于1978年在埃塞俄比亚发现，她的骸骨只有一半多。她生活在距今300到400万年前，比汤恩幼儿早的多。她和汤恩幼儿一样属于南方古猿的种类，但是一种更早的物种，afarensis，即“更早的猿类”。从Lucy的腿、骨盆和脚可以看出她很可能直立行走过，也会爬树或爬上岩石。她的脑腔比一只现代黑猩猩的大不了多少，但与其体型相比较，其脑容量却相对的比黑猩猩更大（脑体比可以更好的衡量精神活动：大象的脑容量比人类更大，但其脑体比更小，当然除了脑容量还有其他很多因素影响智力）。Lucy还不能称作“人类”，但的确有一些混合的特质，她只是她同类中比较成功的一个。

Hundreds of fossil hominins from many parts of the world have allowed us to get a pretty clear idea of the evolutionary path that led to modern human beings. We can even tell what was eaten and what parasites infected our ancestors. The puzzle has many missing pieces, and there is much debate on details: what does this tooth tell us, or the shape of that thigh bone? There will be more surprises in store, too, because fossils are continually unearthed. In Indonesia in 2003, the Australian archaeologist Mike Marwood and his colleagues found fossils of small hominins on the island of Flores. They had lived as recently as 15,000 years ago, but are probably of an unknown species. The exact status of Homo floresiensis('Flores man', nicknamed 'the Hobbit') is still uncertain. Attempts at DNA analysis (the most reliable way of establishing biological relationships) have so far been unsuccessful.

世界各地的数百个hominin化石使我们比较清楚的看到进化到现代人类的途径。我们甚至可以知道我们的祖先吃的是什么食物，感染了什么寄生虫。这个难题还有很多未知的点，还有很多待争论的细节：通过牙齿能知道什么？大腿骨的形状能知道什么？肯定还会有很多惊喜，因为不断的出土新的化石。2003年在印度尼西亚，澳大利亚考古学家Mike Marwood和他的同事在Flore岛上发现了小型hominin的化石。他们生活在15000年前，但很可能是一个未知的种类。Flore人（昵称霍比特人）的确切状态仍然未知，目前未知的DNA分析（确定生物关系的最可靠手段）都没有成功。

Working out how Neanderthals relate to modern humans is an exciting challenge, too. The species certainly lived at the same time as Homo sapiens in Europe, 50,000 or so years ago. We carry some of their genes. Did the coming of Homo sapiens, 'modern' man, contribute to the extinction of Neanderthals? We are not sure. Did they breed with each other? Probably. Both Neanderthals and Homo sapiens suffered from the very cold European temperatures the last time glaciers covered Europe, and the Neanderthals did not survive.

确定尼安德特人与现代人的关系的工作也是令人兴奋的挑战。非常确定，这个人种与智人一样生活在约50000年前的欧洲，我们身体里有他们的一部分基因。智人，也就是现代人的到来是否是尼安德特人灭绝的一个因素呢？我们不是很确定。他们互相合作吗？有可能。尼安德特人和智人在最后一次冰川覆盖欧洲的时候都非常难过，而且尼安德特人没有熬下来。

To reconstruct the human family tree from fossils of differing ages, and in different locations, we use the same tools and techniques as we do for other animals such as the horse or hippopotamus. Of course, there is much more emotion involved, when it's humans rather than hippos. But the evidence is there, and palaeontologists, anthropologists, archaeologists and other specialists continue to put the pieces together. They have used the evidence to work out that hominins, including, at last, Homo sapiens, first lived in Africa and spread from there. There is still much we don't know about the migrations of early hominins. Were there several movements out of Africa? What led to the rapid evolution of the large brain that sets our own species apart from our cousins? Science deals with the how, not the why. This seems especially true when we think about our ancestry and, as Huxley put it, 'man's place in nature.

从不同时代，不同地域的化石重建人类家族树，我们使用的技术与重建马或河马的家族树的一样。当然，这是对人类而不是对河马，所以有很多情感因素在其中。但证据就在那儿，古生物学家，人类学家，考古学家和其他专业人员持续的将零碎的证据拼在一起。他们得出了结论，最初的hominin，包括智人，生活在非洲，而且从那里扩散开来。关于早期hominin的迁徙还有很多我们不知道的，是不是有几波迁徙出非洲的行动？是什么导致了我们快速进化出脑容量增大，从而和我们其他物种的表亲区别开来？科学处理如何的问题，而不是为什么的问题：当我们像Huxley一样思考我们祖先的问题 – 人在自然中的位置 – 的时候，这个结论尤其的正确。

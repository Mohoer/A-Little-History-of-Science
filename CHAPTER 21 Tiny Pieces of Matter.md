# CHAPTER 21 Tiny Pieces of Matter
# 第21章 微小物质单元

Atoms used to have a pretty bad name. Remember the ancient Greeks with their notion of atoms as part of a universe that was random and without purpose? So how is it that for us today, being made up of atoms seems so natural?

原子过去名声不太好。还记得古希腊将原子作为宇宙的一部分的概念是随机无目的的吗？所以今天我们的怎么能认为宇宙由原子组成是这么自然呢？

The modern 'atom' was the brainchild of a thoroughly respectable Quaker, John Dalton (1766-1844). A weaver's son, he went to a good school near where he was born, in the English Lake District. He was especially skilled in mathematics and science, and a famous blind mathematician encouraged his scientific ambitions. Dalton settled in nearby Manchester, a thriving and rapidly growing town during the early Industrial Revolution, when factories began to dominate the making of all kinds of goods. Here he worked as a lecturer and private tutor. He was the first person to give talks on color-blindness, based on his own affliction. For many years, color-blindness was called 'Daltonism'. If you know someone who is color-blind, it is probably a boy, since girls rarely suffer from it.

现代的原子概念是完全值得尊重的贵格会教徒John Dalton (1766-1844)的创见。他是一个织工的儿子，出生于英国Lake区，在那附近上了一所好学校。他非常擅长数学与科学，一位著名的盲人数学家激励起了他的科学志向。Dalton在Manchester附近定居，在工业革命早期这是一个繁荣的、迅速成长的城镇，那时工厂主宰了所有产品的生产。在这里他的工作是一位讲师和私人导师。他是第一个进行色盲方面演讲的人，主要基于他个人的苦恼和折磨，很多年以来，色盲都被称作Dalton病。如果你知道某人是色盲，那么他很可能是个男孩，因为女孩基本上不会得这种病。

Dalton felt right at home at the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. Its active members became a kind of extended family for this shy man who never married. Manchester's ‘Lit. & Phil’ was one of many similar societies established from the late eighteenth century in towns and cities throughout Europe and North America. Benjamin Franklin, the electrician, was one of the founders of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. 'Natural philosophy' was, of course, what we now call ‘science’. The 'Literary' in the Manchester society's name reminds us that science was not yet separated from other areas of intellectual activity; members would gather to hear talks on all sorts of subjects, from Shakespeare's plays to archaeology to chemistry. The age of specialization, when chemists mostly talked to other chemists, or physicists just to other physicists, lay in the future. How exciting to range so broadly!

Dalton在Manchester文学与哲学协会感到如鱼得水，他很内向，从未结婚，这里的活跃会员成为了他的一种扩展家庭。这个协会是18世纪后半期在整个欧洲和北美的城镇里成立的众多类似协会之一。Benjamin Franklin，那个电器技师，是费城的美国哲学协会的创始人之一。自然哲学当然就是现在所说的科学，Manchester协会名字中的“文学”提醒我们科学还未从其他领域的智力活动中分离出来；会员聚集在一起听取各种主题的演讲，从莎士比亚的剧作到考古学到化学。而化学家主要与其他化学家讨论，物理学家只与物理学家讨论，这样的分工时代还在未来。协会涵盖范围如此之广，多么令人感到激动！

Dalton was a leading light in Manchester's scientific life, and his work was gradually appreciated throughout Europe and North America. He did some important experimental work in chemistry, but his reputation then and now rested on his idea of the chemical atom. Earlier chemists had shown that when chemicals react with each other, they do so in predictable ways. When hydrogen 'burns' in ordinary air (part of which is oxygen) the product is always water, and if you measure things carefully, you can see that the proportions of the two gases that combine to form water are always the same. (Don't try this at home, because hydrogen is very easily burned, and can explode.) This same kind of regularity also happened in other chemical experiments with gases, liquids and solids. Why?

Dalton在Manchester的科学生活中起到的是领路人的作用，他的著作逐渐为欧洲和北美所重视。他在化学领域做了一些很重要的实验性工作，但他那时和现在的名声都是基于他的化学原子的概念。更早时候的化学家已经表明，当化学物质相互作用时，其作用方式都是可预测的。当氢气在普通空气（部分是氧气）中燃烧时，总是产生水，如果仔细测量，可以看到两种气体的比例（结合成为水）总是相同的（不要在家里进行尝试，因为氢气极易燃，而且易爆）。这种规律在其他气体、液体和固体的化学实验中也会存在，为什么？

For Lavoisier, in the previous century, this was because elements were the basic units of matter and simply couldn't be broken down into smaller parts. Dalton called the smallest unit of matter the ‘atom’. He insisted that the atoms of one element are all the same, but different from the atoms of other elements. He thought of atoms as extremely small, solid bits of matter, surrounded by heat. The heat around the atom served to help him explain how his atoms, and the compounds they make when joined with other atoms, could exist in various states. For example, atoms of hydrogen and oxygen could exist as solid ice (when they had the least heat), or as liquid water, or as water vapor (when they had the most heat).

对Lavoisier来说，在上个世纪里，这是因为元素是物质的基本单位，不能被分解成更小的部分。Dalton将物质的最小单位成为“原子”。他坚持认为一种元素的原子都是一样的，但与其他元素的原子不一样。他认为原子是极其小的固态物质微粒，周围是热。原子周围热量的作用是可以帮助解释原子，以及原子与其他原子形成化合物时，可以以不同形态存在。比如，氢气与氧气的原子可以以固态的冰存在（其热量最小），或者以液态水形式存在，或者以水蒸气形式存在（含有热量最高）。

Dalton made models with little cut-outs to stand for his atoms. He marked his cardboard cut-outs with symbols, to save space (and time) when writing the names of compounds and their reactions (just as if he were sending a modern text message). At first his system was far too awkward to be used easily, but it was the right idea, so gradually chemists decided to use initials as the symbols for elements (and therefore Dalton's atoms). So hydrogen became 'H', oxygen 'O', and carbon 'C'. Another letter sometimes had to be added to avoid confusion: for example, when helium was discovered later, it couldn't be H so became ‘He’.

Dalton为表示原子做了一些带有图案的模型。他给他的硬纸板图案模型标上各种符号来代表原子，这样在写化合物的名字和它们的反应时可以节省空间和时间（就像在发送现代短信似的）。一开始他的系统很笨拙，不能很容易得到应用，但这个主意是对的，所以逐渐的化学家决定用首字母作为元素的符号（也就是Dalton的原子）。所以氢气就是H，氧气就是O，碳就是C。为了防止歧义，有时候需要再加一个字母，比如，当后面发现了氦气时，就不能是H，所以就成了He。

The beauty of Dalton's atomic theory was that it allowed chemists to know things about these bits of matter that they could never actually see. If all the atoms in an element are the same, then they must weigh the same, so chemists could measure how much one weighed compared to another. In a compound made of different kinds of atoms, they could measure how much of each atom there was in the compound, by relative weight. (Dalton couldn't actually measure how much an individual atom weighed, so atomic weights were merely compared with the weights of other atoms.) Dalton led the way here, and he didn't always get it right. For instance, when oxygen and hydrogen combine to form water, he assumed that one atom of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen were involved. Based on his careful weighing, he gave the atomic weight of hydrogen as 1 (hydrogen was the lightest known element), and the atomic weight of oxygen as 7, so he said they had a weight ratio of 1 to 7, or 1:7. He always rounded his atomic weights to whole numbers and the comparative weights he was working with suggested he was right. In fact, the weight ratios in water are more like 1:8. We also now know that there are two atoms of hydrogen in each molecule of water, so the ratio of atomic weights is actually 1:16 - one of hydrogen to sixteen of oxygen. The current atomic weight of oxygen is 16. Hydrogen has retained the magical weight of 1, which Dalton gave it. Hydrogen is not only the lightest atom, it is also the most common one in the universe.

Dalton的原子理论的优美之处在于这使化学家可以知道它们永远无法看到的物质微粒，如果同一元素的所有原子都是一样的，那么其重量肯定是一样的，所以化学家可以测量一个与另一个的重量对比。在由不同种类的原子组成的化合物中，它们可以通过相对质量测量化合物中都有多少个各类原子。（Dalton不能实际测量出一个单独的原子个体多重，所以原子重量只是与其他原子相比得到的。）Dalton将路带到了这里，而且没有永远带对路。比如，当氧和氢燃烧形成水时，他认为是一个氢原子和一个氧原子在发生作用。通过他仔细的称重，他将氢原子质量设为1（氢是最轻的已知元素），氧气的相对原子质量是7，所以他说它们的质量比为1:7,。他一直将原子质量近似为整数，他工作得出的相对原子质量也说明他是正确的。实际上，水中氢氧的比例更应该是1:8。我们还知道水分子中有2个氢原子，所以实际原子质量比是1:16，氢原子是1，氧原子是16，现在氧原子的相对原子质量就是16。Dalton认定氢原子相对原子质量是1，后面就一直维持在1。氢原子不仅是最轻的原子，而且还是宇宙中最常见的原子。

Dalton's atomic theory made sense of chemical reactions, by showing how elements or atoms combine in definite proportions. So, hydrogen and oxygen do this when they form water, and carbon and oxygen when they make carbon dioxide, and nitrogen and hydrogen when they make ammonium. Such regularity and consistency, as well as increasingly accurate tools for measurement, made chemistry a cutting-edge science in the early nineteenth century. Dalton's atomic theory provided its foundation.

Dalton的原子理论使化学反应有了意义，这是通过发现元素或原子的结合比例是一定的展示的。所以，氢和氧以一定比例形成水，碳和氧以一定比例制造出二氧化碳，氮和氢以一定比例形成氨气。这种规律性和一致性，以及测量工具精确度的不断提高，使化学成为19世纪初的尖端科学。Dalton的原子理论提供了基础。

Humphry Davy (1778-1829) was at the center of this chemistry. Whereas Dalton was quiet, Davy was flamboyant and socially ambitious. Like Dalton, he came from a working-class background, and went to a good local school in Cornwall. He was lucky, too. He was apprenticed to a nearby doctor who was to train Davy to become a family doctor. Instead, Davy used the books that his master owned to educate himself in chemistry (and foreign languages). He moved to Bristol, becoming an assistant in a special medical institution that used different gases to treat patients. While there, Davy experimented with nitrous oxide – called 'laughing gas' because when you breathed it, it made you want to laugh. Davy's book on the gas, published in 1800, caused a sensation, for nitrous oxide had become a 'recreational drug' and nitrous oxide parties were all the rage. Davy also noted that, after breathing the gas, you didn't feel pain, and suggested that it might be useful in medicine. It took forty years before doctors took up his suggestion, and the gas is still sometimes used as an anaesthetic in modern dentistry and medicine.

Humphry Davy (1778-1829)处在化学的最中心。虽然Dalton很安静，Davy则非常活跃，很有社交志向。和Dalton一样，他也是工薪阶层出身，在Cornwall上了当地学校，他也非常幸运，成为了附近一位医生的学徒，希望将Davy训练成一位家庭医生。而Davy用他老师的书自学化学（和外语）。他搬到了Bristol，成为了一个特殊医学机构的助理，这个机构用各种不同气体来为病人治病。在那里的时候，Davy对一氧化氮进行了实验，这种气体称为“笑气”，因为当你吸入这种气体时，会让你想笑。Davy关于气体的书出版于1800年，产生了轰动，因为一氧化氮成为了休闲药品，一氧化氮俱乐部忽然流行起来。Davy还指出，在吸入这种气体后，你不会感受到疼痛，建议这可以用在医学中。医生们花了40年才接受了这个建议，现在这种气体有时候仍然在牙科和医学中用作麻药。

Only the great city of London could satisfy Davy's ambitions. He got his chance to become lecturer in chemistry at the Royal Institution, an organization that brought science to the middle-class public. Davy the showman thrived there. His talks on chemistry attracted large crowds - people often went to lectures for fun as well as to learn. Davy became a professor at the Institution, and his research flourished. Along with other chemists, he discovered the chemical use of Volta's electrical 'pile', the first battery. He dissolved compounds in liquids to make solutions and then used the pile to pass an electric current through them, analyzing what happened. What he saw is that in many solutions, the elements and compounds were attracted to either the negative or the positive ends (poles) of the pile. Davy identified several new elements this way: sodium and potassium, for instance, which both accumulated around the negative pole. Sodium is part of the compound sodium chloride, the substance that makes the ocean salty, and which we put on our food. Once new elements were discovered, Davy could experiment with them, and work out their relative atomic weights.

只有伦敦这座伟大的城市可以满足Davy的志向。皇家协会将科学带给中产阶级公众，Davy有机会在这里开设讲座讲授化学。Davy成功的在这里成为一位表演者。他关于化学的演讲吸引了大批观众，人们来到他的讲座为了娱乐也为了学习。Davy成为了机构的教授，他的研究工作获得成功。和其他化学家一起，他发现了Volta的电池组的化学用途，第一个电池。他将化合物溶入液体中，成为溶液，用电池组使其通电，分析发生了什么。他发现在很多溶液里，元素和化合物被吸引到电池组的正极端或负极端。Davy用这种方式识别出了几种新元素，比如钠和钾，它们都会被吸引到负极。钠是氯化钠，也就是食盐这种化合物的一部分。一旦发现了新元素，Davy就可以对其进行实验，并计算出其相对原子质量。

Volta's pile, with its positive and negative poles, also changed the way chemists thought about atoms and chemical compounds. Positively charged things went towards the negative pole, and negatively charged ones to the positive pole. This helped explain why elements had natural tendencies to combine with each other. The Swedish chemist Jons Jacob Berzelius (1779-1848) made this fact central to his famous theory of chemical combination. Berzelius survived a difficult childhood. Both his parents died when he was young and he was brought up by various relatives. But he grew up to become one of the most influential chemists in Europe. He discovered the joys of chemical research when he was training to be a doctor, and was able to work as a chemist in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, where he lived. He also traveled a lot, particularly to Paris and London - exciting places for a chemist.

Volta的电池组有正极和负极，也改变了化学家对原子和化学化合物的想法。带正电的物质向负极运动，带负电的向正极运动。这也解释了为什么元素为什么有相互结合的自然趋势。瑞典化学家Jons Jacob Berzelius (1779-1848)创造出了著名的化学结合理论，其中心思想就是这个。Berzelius童年时非常艰难，很小时父母就去世了，被很多亲戚带大，但长大后成长为欧洲最有影响力的化学家之一。他本来受到的是医学训练，但发现了化学研究的乐趣，而且得以在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩作为化学家工作，他也居住在那里。他也旅行很多，尤其是到巴黎和伦敦，这都是令化学家激动的地方。

Like Davy, Berzelius used the Voltaic pile to look at compounds in solution. He discovered several new elements this way, and he published lists of them with ever more accurate atomic weights. He worked out the weights by carefully analyzing the relative weights of substances combining to make new compounds, or by breaking down compounds and then carefully measuring the products. His chemical table of 1818 listed the atomic weights of forty-five elements, with hydrogen still as 1. It also gave the known compositions of over 2,000 compounds. It was Berzelius who popularized Dalton's convention of identifying elements by the first one or two letters of their name: C for carbon, Ca for calcium, and so on. This made the language of chemical reactions much easier to read. When compounds have more than one atom of an element in them, he indicated it with a number following the letter. Berzelius placed the number above the letter, but scientists now put it below: O2 means there are two atoms of oxygen. Apart from that, Berzelius wrote chemical formulas much as we do today.

和Davy一样，Berzelius用Volta电池组来观察溶液中的化合物。他也用这种方法发现了几种新元素，他精确测量了其相对原子质量，并发表了出来。他测量相对质量的方法包括仔细分析形成的新化合物所用的物质的相对质量，或分解化合物然后仔细测量生成物。他在1818年的化学表格列出了45种元素的相对原子质量，氢原子仍是1，还给出了已知的2000多种化合物的组成。是Berzelius让Dalton的用第一个或前两个字母代表元素的惯例流行起来：C代表碳，Ca代表钙，等等。这使化学反应的语言更加易读。当化合物包括一种元素的几个原子，他用字母后的数字表示出这个意思。Berzelius将数字放在字母上面，但现在的科学家都放在下面：O2意思是氧气有2个氧原子。除了这个，Berzelius的化学公式和我们今天的差不多。

Berzelius was much better with inorganic compounds than with organic ones. 'Organic' compounds are ones containing carbon and are associated with living things: sugars and proteins are two examples. Organic compounds are often more complex chemically than inorganic ones, and they tend to react in rather different ways than the acids, salts and minerals that Berzelius was mostly examining. Berzelius thought that the reactions that go on in our bodies (or those of other living things such as trees and cows) could not be explained in quite the same way as those that happen in a laboratory. Organic chemistry was being developed during his lifetime in France and Germany, and although he distanced himself from these chemists, he actually contributed to their research. First, he provided the word 'protein' to describe one of the most important kinds of organic compounds. Second, he realized that many chemical reactions will not take place unless there is a third substance present. He called this third thing a 'catalyst'. It helped the reaction - often by speeding it up - but it did not actually change during the reaction, unlike the other chemicals that combined or broke down. Catalysts are found throughout nature, and trying to understand how they work has been the goal of many chemists since Berzelius's time.

Berzelius更擅长于无机化合物。“有机”化合物是含碳并与生物有关的化合物：糖与蛋白质是两个例子。有机化合物在化学组成上比无机化合物更加复杂，Berzelius主要实验酸、盐和矿物质的相互反应，而有机化合物的反应方式与这非常不同。Berzelius认为我们体内进行的反应（或者说其他生物比如树木或奶牛）不能被实验室中进行的实验所解释。有机化学在他的一生中在法国和德国得到发展，虽然他与这些化学家保持距离，但他还是为他们的研究做出了贡献。第一，他发明了“蛋白质”来描述最重要的一种有机化合物；第二，他意识到很多化学实验只有在第三种物质存在时候才会发生反应。他称这第三种物质为“催化剂”，它通常加速反应的进行，但反应过程中本身并不发生变化，不像别的化学物质都被合并或分解。催化剂被发现在自然中到处存在，Berzelius以来的化学家很多都以理解其工作机理作为目标。

Elsewhere in Europe, 'atoms' were helping chemists understand their work. There were still a lot of puzzles, however. In 1811, in Italy, the physicist Amedeo Avogadro (1776-1856) made a bold statement. It was so bold that it was neglected by chemists for almost forty years. He declared that the number of particles of any gas in a fixed volume and at the same temperature is always identical. ‘Avogadro’s hypothesis’, as it came to be called, had important consequences. It meant that the molecular weights of gases could be calculated directly, using a formula he devised. His idea, or hypothesis, also helped modify Dalton's atomic theory, because it explained a curious feature of one of the most studied gases, water vapor. Chemists had long puzzled why the volume of hydrogen and oxygen in a particular amount of water vapor was incorrect if one assumed one atom of hydrogen and one of oxygen combined to make a molecule of water. It turned out that there were two atoms of hydrogen for every atom of oxygen in water vapor. Chemists discovered that many gases, including both hydrogen and oxygen, exist in nature not as single atoms but as molecules: two or more atoms joined together: H2 and O2 , as we would say.

在欧洲其他地方，原子的概念帮助化学家理解他们的工作，但仍然有很多谜团。1811年，在意大利，物理学家Amedeo Avogadro (1776-1856)作出了一个大胆的声明，太大胆了以至于被化学家忽视了几乎40年，他声称恒定温度下固定体积内的气体粒子数目是一样的，这后来被称为Avogadro假设，其影响非常重要，这意味着气体分子的质量是可以用他给出的公式直接计算出来的。他的理论，或假说，也帮助修正了Dalton的原子理论，因为它解释了研究的最多的水蒸气的古怪特征。如果假设一个氢原子与一个氧原子结合成为水分子，那么在特定质量的水蒸气中氢气和氧气的体积总是不对，科学家被这个问题困扰了很久。结果原来是两个氢原子与一个氧原子形成水分子。化学家发现很多气体，包括氢气和氧气，不是以单原子而是以分子的形式在自然界中存在，两个或更多的原子结合起来成为分子，比如H2和O2。

Avogadro's ideas didn't seem to make sense, if you believed Dalton's atomic theory, and Berzelius's idea of the atoms of elements having definite negative or positive characteristics. How could two negative oxygen atoms bind together? These problems meant that Avogadro's work was neglected for a long time. Much later on, though, it made sense of many chemical puzzles and is now fundamental to our understanding of the chemist's atom. Science is often like that: all the pieces only fit together after a long time and then things start to make sense.

如果你相信Dalton的原子理论，以及Berzelius认为元素的原子带有确定的正或负的特征的观点，那么Avogadro的想法似乎没有意义。怎么可能两个负的氧原子会结合在一起呢？这些问题意味着Avogadro的工作在很长时间内被忽视。但很久以后，这使得很多化学谜题得到解决，现在是理解化学原子的基础。科学经常是这样的：所有的碎片在很久以后才能拼在一起，那时事物才开始有意义。

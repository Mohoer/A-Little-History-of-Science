# CHAPTER 12 Leaning Towers and Telescopes - Galileo
# 第12章 斜塔和望远镜 – 伽利略

One of the strangest buildings in the world must be the 850-year-old bell tower of the cathedral in the city of Pisa in Italy. You may know it as the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It's fun to take photographs of a friend in front of it pretending to hold the tilting tower from falling. There are also stories about how Galileo used the tower to perform his own experiments - dropping two balls of different weights from the top to see which would land first. In fact, Galileo didn't use the tower, but he did other experiments that showed him what the result would be, and he found that a ten-pound ball and a one-pound ball would hit the ground at the same time. Like the sun not moving around the earth each day, this experiment seemed to go against our everyday experience. After all, a feather and a ball dropped from the tower do not fall at the same rate. Why would the differently weighted balls drop to earth together?

世界最奇特的一栋建筑莫过于有850年历史的意大利比萨教堂钟塔，以比萨斜塔为人所知，在塔前假装你顶住了塔才没有倒掉是件很有意思的事。也有故事讲伽利略怎样用斜塔做实验，将两个不同重量的球从塔顶丢下，看看哪个会先落地。实际上，伽利略并没有在塔上做实验，但他做了其他实验展示了实验结果，他发现10磅的球和1磅的球会同时落地。就像太阳不是绕着地球转动一样，实验结果似乎有悖于我们的日常常识。毕竟从塔顶丢下一个球和一只羽毛不会以同样的速度掉落。为什么不同重量的球会同时掉到地上呢？

Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was born in Pisa. (Galilei was the family name, but our hero is always known by his first name.) His father was a musician and Galileo actually grew up in nearby Florence. He returned to the University of Pisa as a young man, starting to study medicine, but he was always more interested in mathematics, and he left the university with a reputation for cleverness and quick wit. In 1592, he went to Padua to teach mathematics and what we would call physics. He was there when William Harvey, whom we shall meet shortly, was a student, and it's a shame that the two probably never met each other.

伽利略（1564-1642）生于比萨（Galilei是家族名，但英雄被人知道的永远是第一名字）。他的父亲是一个音乐家，伽利略实际上在附近的佛罗伦萨长大。他长成年轻人后回到比萨大学念书，开始学习医学，但他总是对数学更感兴趣，毕业的时候大家都认为他很聪明，反应机敏。1592年，他到Padua教授数学，其内容我们现在称之为物理。他在那里时，我们后面会讲到的William Harvey正是那里的一个学生，但很可惜他们两个可能从没遇见过。

Galileo attracted controversy throughout his life. His ideas always seemed to challenge accepted views, especially the physics and astronomy of Aristotle and the other Ancients. He was a good Catholic, but it was also his belief that religion is about morality and faith, whilst science deals with the observable, physical world. As he put it, the Bible teaches how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go. This brought him into conflict with the Catholic Church, which was energetically defending itself against those who dared to challenge either its ideas or its authority. The Church also started policing the growing number of books that were produced by the printing presses, placing unacceptable ones on a list they called the Index Librorum Prohibitorum - the ‘List of Banned Books’. Galileo, who had many friends in high places (including princes, bishops, cardinals and even popes), had the support of many churchmen, but others were determined not to allow his ideas to upset their teachings, which were centuries-old.

伽利略的一生充满了辩论。他的观点似乎总是与挑战现有的成见，尤其是亚里士多德和其他古代先贤的物理与天文学的观点。他是个很好的罗马天主教徒，但他同时也认为宗教是有关道德和信仰的，而科学是与可观察的物理世界打交道的。就像他说的那样，圣经是教人如何上天堂，而不是天体是如何运行的。这将他卷入了与罗马天主教会的冲突之中，后者正积极的防御那些胆敢挑战其观点或权威的人。教会还开始管理出版社印刷的越来越多的书籍，将不可接受的放在禁书名单上。伽利略有很多高层的朋友（包括王子，主教，红衣主教，甚至教皇），很多教堂的人都支持他，但其他人还是决定不采用他的观点，继续那些有数百年历史的教学。

Galileo's early work was with the forces involved in moving objects. From the very beginning he was someone who wanted to observe and measure things for himself, and if possible to express his results mathematically. In one of his most famous experiments, he carefully rolled a ball down a tilted surface and measured how long it took to reach certain distances. As you can imagine, the ball picks up speed as it moves down the slope (we would say it accelerates). Galileo saw that there was a special relationship between the speed of the ball and the time that had passed since it started moving. The speed was related to the square (a value multiplied by itself, such as 3 x 3) of the time taken. So, after two seconds, Galileo discovered that the ball would be traveling four times as fast. (The square of the time taken also appears in later scientists' work, so look out for it. Nature seems to like things squared.)

伽利略的早期工作是关注运动的物体的受力。从最开始，他就是要亲自进行观察、测量，如果可能的话，就将结果用数学表达出来。在他一个最著名的实验中，他小心将一个球从倾斜平面上滑下来，测量到达特定距离所花的时间。你可以想象，小球向斜坡下运动时，会逐渐加速。伽利略发现，球的速度与开始运动之后的时间有一个特殊关系，速度与时间的平方有关，所以伽利略发现，过了两秒之后，球的速度会变成四倍（时间的平方在以后科学家的工作中不断出现，所以要多加注意这个，自然似乎喜欢东西的平方）。

In all these, and many more experiments, Galileo showed himself to be a very modern scientist, because he knew that his actual measurements were not always exactly the same; sometimes we blink at a bad moment, or it takes time for us to record what we see, or the equipment isn't perfect. However, these are the kinds of observations we can make about the real world, and Galileo was always most interested in the world as we find it, not in some abstract world where everything was always perfect and exact.

在所有这些以及更多的试验中，伽利略展示了自己作为一个非常现代的科学家形象，因为他知道他的实际测量不总是完全一样，有时候在关键时刻我们会眨眼，或者记录看到的东西需要时间，或者仪器设备不完美。但对现实世界有多种观测方法，伽利略对发现的世界总是极感兴趣，而并不是停留在所有事物都完美和精确的抽象世界中。

Galileo's early work on moving objects showed how differently he saw the world as compared with Aristotle and the hundreds of thinkers who had come after, despite Aristotle's continuing importance in the universities, which were governed by religious groups. In 1609, Galileo learned of a new instrument that would challenge the ancient way of thinking even more seriously. This instrument was soon to be called the 'telescope’, a word that means 'to see far', just as 'telephone' means 'to speak far', and 'microscope' means 'to see small’. Both telescopes and microscopes have been very important in the history of science.

伽利略关于运动物体的早期工作展示了他看世界的观点与亚里士多德及其之后的数百位思想家是多么的不同，尽管亚里士多德在教会团体主导的大学中有持续的重要性。在1609年，伽利略听说了一种新的仪器，很快就可以更认真的挑战古代的思考方式。这种仪器很快就被称为“望远镜”，意思就是可以“看的很远”，就像“电话”的意思是“说的很远”，“显微镜”意思是“看到很小的东西”。望远镜和显微镜在科学的历史中占据了重要的地位。

The first telescope that Galileo constructed offered only a little magnification, but he was very impressed with it. He quickly improved it by combining two lenses, so that he could get the kind of magnifying power that we expect from an ordinary pair of binoculars today, about fifteen times. That doesn't sound like much, but it created a sensation. Using it, one could spot ships coming in from the sea long before they were visible to the naked eye. More importantly, Galileo turned his telescope to the heavens and was amazed at what he found there.

伽利略设计的第一个望远镜只能放大少许，但他对这个印象深刻。他很快就通过使用两块透镜进行了改进，这样他就得到了现代普通的双目望远镜大约15倍的放大能力。听起来并不是很多，但它创造了轰动。使用这个，一个人很快就可以看到大海远处航行过来的船，远比裸眼能看到的要早的多。更重要的是，伽利略将望远镜对向了天空，然后的发现让他大为吃惊。

When he looked at the moon, he realized that it was not the perfect, smooth, circular ball that people had supposed. It had mountains and craters. Turning his telescope towards the planets, he observed their movements more closely, and discovered that one planet, Jupiter, had 'moons' just as the earth had its moon. Another planet, Saturn, had two big blobs which didn't look like moons and which we now call its 'rings'. He could see the movements of Venus and Mars much more clearly, and agreed that they changed their direction and speed in a regular and predictable way. The sun had dark areas or spots, which moved a bit each day in regular patterns. (He learned to look at it indirectly, to protect his eyes, as you must.) His telescope revealed that the Milky Way, which appears as a wonderful, fuzzy blur of light when looking with the naked eye on a clear night, was actually composed of thousands and thousands of individual stars, very far away from the earth.

当他观察月亮时，他观察到月亮并不是人们认为的完美光滑圆形的球体，月亮上也有山脉和坑。将望远镜对向其他行星，他仔细的近距离观察了行星的运动，他发现其中一个行星，木星，和地球一样也有类似月亮的卫星。另一个行星，土星，有两个与月亮不那么类似的大团，我们现在称之为“环”。他还可以更清楚的看到金星和火星的运动，同意它们会有规律并可以预见的变换运动方向和速度。太阳有黑暗的区域或黑点，每天都会按照有规则的模式运动一点（他学会了不直接观察太阳，以保护眼睛，这是必须的）。他的望远镜揭示了银河实际上是由距离地球很远的成千上万的星星组成的，而不是人们在晴朗的夜晚用肉眼观察到的奇妙又模糊的闪光。

With his telescope, Galileo made these and many other important observations. He wrote about them in a book called Starry Messenger (1610), which created a stir. Each revelation called into question what people thought about the heavens. Some thought Galileo's ideas were based on tricks played by his new ‘tube’, as the telescope was often called, because what could not be seen by the naked eye might not be there. Galileo had to try to convince people that what his telescope showed was real.

有了望远镜，伽利略得到了这些以及其他很多观测结果。他将这些写成了一本书《星际信使》（1610），轰动一时。揭示的每个信息都对人们对天空的常识提出了质疑。有人认为伽利略的观点都是那个小“管子”的把戏，当时人们就这么称呼望远镜，因为肉眼看不到的东西可能根本就不在那里。伽利略必须让人们相信，望远镜看到的东西是真的。

Much more awkwardly, and dangerously, was that Galileo's observations were good evidence for Copernicus being right about the moon revolving around the earth, and about the earth, moon and the other planets all orbiting around the sun. By this time, Copernicus's book had been in print for almost seventy years, and he had a number of followers, Protestants as well as Catholics. The official position of the Catholic Church was that Copernicus's ideas were useful to work out the movements of the planets, but they were not literally true. If they were, too many passages from the Bible would be complicated, and have to be thought about again.

更尴尬和危险的是，伽利略的观测结果都是哥白尼观点的最好的证明，月亮绕着地球转，地球、月亮和其他行星都绕着太阳转。到那个时候，哥白尼的书已经印刷了70年了，有相当数量的追随者，有新教徒，也有罗马天主教徒。罗马教廷的官方立场是，哥白尼的观点对于计算行星运动是有用的，但不是正确的。如果是的话，圣经里很多章节就会非常复杂了，必须重新进行思考。

But Galileo wanted to tell people about his astronomical findings. He went to Rome in 1615 hoping to get the Church's permission to teach what he had learned. Many people - even the Pope - sympathized with him, but he was still forbidden to write about, or teach, Copernicus's system. He didn't give up entirely, going to Rome again in 1624 and 1630 to test the waters, though he was getting old and unwell. He became convinced that as long as he was careful to present the Copernican system only as a possibility then he would be safe. His work on astronomy, Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, is written as a conversation between three people: one representing Aristotle, another representing Copernicus, and the third acting as the host. That way, Galileo could discuss the pros and cons of old and new ideas about the universe without having to say which was right or wrong.

但伽利略希望把他的天文学发现告诉人们。他1615年到了罗马，希望得到教廷允许，教授他所学到的内容。包括教皇的很多人都很同情他，但仍然禁止了他写的书，也不能教授哥白尼的体系。他没有完全放弃，1624、1630年又去过罗马两次，试试风声，那时候他已经又老又病了。他相信，只要他小心的将哥白尼体系讲成一种可能性，他就是安全的。他的天文学巨作，《两大世界体系的对话》，是以三人对话的方式写成的：一个代表亚里士多德，一个代表哥白尼，第三个代表主人。这样，伽利略就可以讨论关于宇宙新老观点的正反意见，而不用说出哪个对哪个错。

It is a wonderful book, full of jokes, and written, like most of Galileo's works, in his native language, Italian. (Scholars from all over Europe still usually wrote their books in Latin.) From the start, it was pretty obvious which side Galileo was on. For one thing, the Aristotelian character was named Simplicio. Now, there was in fact an ancient commentator on Aristotle called that, but just as in English, in Italian it sounds like ‘simpleton’, and this character isn't very bright. The Copernican (called Salviati, a name that suggests 'wise' and 'safe') has by far the best lines and arguments.

这是本奇妙的书，满是笑话，和其他伽利略的著作一样，是用其母语意大利语写的（现在整个欧洲的学者仍然经常用拉丁文写书）。从一开始，伽利略站在哪一方就很明显。首先，代表亚里士多德的那个角色叫Simplicio，现在实际上有一个亚里士多德的解说员叫这个，意大利语中听起来很像“傻瓜”，而且角色不是那么聪明。代表哥白尼的那个角色（叫Salviati，大致意思是明智的，安全的）则有最好的台词和辩论。

Galileo tried very hard to get the Church's official approval for his book. The censor in Rome, who controlled which books could be published, was sympathetic to Galileo, but he knew there would be problems and so delayed his decision. Galileo went ahead and had the book printed in Florence. When the high churchmen in Rome read it, they were not pleased, and summoned the old man to Rome. Someone dug out a copy of the old ban against him teaching the Copernican system, and after a 'trial' in 1633 that went on for three months, Galileo was forced to say his book was an error and the product of his vanity. The earth, he said in his signed confession, does not move and is the centre of the universe. There is a legend that immediately after being convicted, Galileo muttered, 'Eppur si muove' ('And yet it moves'). Whether or not he did say it out loud, he certainly thought it, for the Church could not force him to change his beliefs about the nature of the world.

伽利略非常努力才得到了教廷的官方批准出版这本书。罗马控制哪些书可以出版的审查者对伽利略是很同情的，但他知道会有问题，所以推迟了决定时间。伽利略继续前进，在佛罗伦萨出版了这本书。当罗马的高级教士看到了这本书，他们很不高兴，将这位老人召唤到罗马。有人挖出了一本老的禁令，防止他教授哥白尼体系，1633年进行了三个月的“审讯”，伽利略被迫说明这本书是个错误，是他虚荣心的产物。在他签字的忏悔中，他说地球并不运动，是宇宙的中心。传说他被定罪后，伽利略立刻就咕哝着说，“但是它运动啊”。不论是否大声说了出来，他肯定有这个想法，因为教廷无法强迫改变他关于自然世界的信仰。

The Church had the power to throw Galileo in prison and even torture him, but his jury recognized that he was a very unusual man, and put him under house arrest instead. His first 'house arrest' in the city of Siena wasn't all that strict - he was the life and soul of many dinner parties - so the Church insisted that he return to his home outside Florence, where his visitors were carefully policed. One of Galileo's daughters (a nun) died soon after, and his last years were lonely. But he continued his work, returning to the problems of falling objects and the forces that produce the kinds of movement we see around us every day. His great work, Two New Sciences (1638), is one of the foundations of modern physics. He looked again at the acceleration of falling bodies, and used mathematics to show that acceleration could be measured in a way that anticipated Isaac Newton's later famous work on gravity. He also offered a new way of thinking about the paths of things shot through the air, like cannon-balls, showing how it could be predicted where they would land. With this work, the concept of 'force' - what influences something to move in a particular way - took its place in the study of physics.

教廷有能力将伽利略扔进监狱并折磨他，但陪审团承认他是个非常不寻常的人，所以将其监禁在家。他第一次监禁在Siena市的家没那么严格，他是很多晚宴派对的核心人物，所以教廷坚持让他回到佛罗伦萨外的家，这样他的客人都能得到监管。伽利略的一个女儿（一个修女）在这之后很快去世，他的晚年是孤独的。但他继续坚持工作，回到掉落物体的问题上，以及产生每天都可以看到的运动的作用力上。他的巨作，《两种新科学》（1638），是现代物理的基础之一。他再次观察了自由落体运动的加速情况，用数学计算出加速是可以测量出来的，这与后世牛顿关于重力的著名工作相类似。他还提出了预测加农炮弹这样的物体穿过空气的路径的新思想，展示怎样预测落地点。他关于“力”（影响物体运动的东西）的概念的工作使他在物理中占有一席之地。

If you've ever heard the phrase 'rebel without a cause', then Galileo was a rebel with a cause. The thing he fought for was science as knowledge that can explain the way the world works in its own terms. Some of his rebellious ideas were later abandoned because they were wrong, or did not fully explain things. But that's the way science always works, and no area of science is a closed book containing all the answers. Just as all modern scientists should, Galileo knew this.

如果你曾听过短语“无故反叛”，那伽利略是一个有故反叛者。他所为止奋斗的科学，是可以解释世界运转的知识，他有些反叛的观点后面被抛弃了，因为那些是错误的，或者没有充分解释事物。但这就是科学的方式，没有哪个科学的领域是包含所有答案的全书。就像所有现代科学家那样，伽利略也知道这一点。

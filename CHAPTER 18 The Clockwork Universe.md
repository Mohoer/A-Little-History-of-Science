# CHAPTER 18 The Clockwork Universe
# 第18章 机械宇宙

The American Revolution (also known as the American War of Independence) in 1776, the French Revolution in 1789, and the Russian Revolution in 1917 each swiftly brought about new forms of government and a new social order. There was also a Newtonian Revolution. Fewer people have heard of the Newtonian Revolution, but it was just as important, and although it took decades rather than years to work its effect, its consequences were profound. The Newtonian Revolution described the world in which we live. 

1776年的美国独立战争（又名革命），1789年的法国大革命，1917年的俄国大革命都迅速带来了新式的政府和新的社会秩序。其实还有一场牛顿大革命，极少有人听说过牛顿大革命，但也是非常重要的，虽然耗费时间较长，大约几十年才有效果，但其影响是深远的。牛顿大革命描绘了我们生活的世界。

After he died in 1727, Sir Isaac continued to be a towering figure in the eighteenth century. In every field of endeavor, people wanted to be the 'Newton' of their subject. Adam Smith wanted to be the Newton of economics; some called William Cullen the Newton of medicine; Jeremy Bentham strove to be the Newton of social and political reform. What they all sought was a general law or principle that would glue their discipline together, just as Newton's gravity seemed to hold the universe in its regular and stately progression through the seasons and years. As the poet Alexander Pope joked, ‘Nature, and Nature's laws lay hid in night. / God said, Let Newton be! and all was light’.

牛顿去世于1727年，但整个18世纪都是灯塔式的人物，人们都希望成为各自领域内牛顿式的人物。亚当斯密希望成为经济界的牛顿，有人称William Cullen是医学界的牛顿，Jeremy Bentham努力想成为社会和政治改革中的牛顿。他们寻找的都是将其规章制度粘合到一起的通用准则，就像牛顿的重力公式是宇宙通用的，不论季节和年份。就像诗人Alexander Pope开玩笑说的，“自然，自然的法则隐藏在黑夜中。上帝说，让牛顿来！于是所有的法则都出现了”。

As an Englishman, Pope might have been biased in favor of his countryman. In France, Germany and Italy, Newton cut a sizeable figure even in his own lifetime, but there were other scientific traditions that still counted. In France, Descartes' mechanical vision of the universe remained powerful. In Germany there were squabbles over who had invented calculus, with the admirers of the philosopher G.W. Leibniz (1646-1716) insisting that Newton was less important in developing this mathematical tool than their man. In Britain, however, Newton attracted many followers, who were only too pleased to call themselves 'Newtonians', and who used his magnificent insights in mathematics, physics, astronomy and optics.

作为一个英国人，Pope可能有点偏袒了他的同胞牛顿。在法国、德国和意大利，牛顿终身都相当引人注目，但各国还是有其他的科学传统的。在法国，笛卡尔关于宇宙的力学见解仍然非常有影响；在德国，有关谁发明了微积分仍然有争论，哲学家G.W. Leibniz (1646-1716)的钦佩者坚持认为在发展这种数学工具上，牛顿的重要性没有他那么高。但在英国，牛顿还是有非常多的追随者，他们乐意称自己为“牛顿学说拥护者”，牛顿在数学、物理、天文学和光学中都有非常深入的洞见。

Gradually, however, the power of Newton's experimental optics and laws of motion also took hold of European thought. His reputation was helped by a most unlikely advocate: the poet, novelist and man of letters Voltaire (1694-1778). Voltaire's most famous creation was the loveable character, Candide, who featured in an adventure story. Candide lives a life of continuous disaster - everything that can go wrong does go wrong - but he never forgets his philosophy: the world that God has created must be the best possible one. So he remains cheerful, sure that what happens to him, no matter how dreadful, is for the best ‘in this best of possible worlds’. (After his horrible adventures he decides that he should have stayed at home and tended his garden: pretty good advice, actually.)

但逐渐的，牛顿实验光学和运动定律的威力对欧洲的思想影响力越来越大。一个最不可能的人，诗人、小说家和文学家伏尔泰(1694-1778)帮助扩散了他的声誉，Voltaire最重要的创作是冒险故事中的可爱角色“老实人”Candide。“老实人”的生活一直都是灾祸不断，所有能出错的事都出了错，但他永远没有忘记他的生活哲学：上帝创造的世界肯定是最好的世界。所以他保持开心，坚信发生在他身上的事情不论多糟糕，都是为了这个最好的可能世界的好。（在他糟糕的经历后，他决定他还是待在家里照看花园比较好：实际上这是非常好的建议。）

Candide was a gentle dig at the philosophy of Newton's rival in the invention of calculus, Leibniz. Voltaire was a great fan of Newton and, in fact, all things English. He spent a couple of years in England and was very impressed with the freedom of speech and thought there. (Voltaire was imprisoned at home in France for criticizing the Catholic Church and the French king, so he knew how important free speech is.) He also came away from England appreciating Newton's achievements, and he wrote a popular version of Newton's ideas for ordinary people in French. Voltaire's book found many readers in Europe, where everyone was discussing the ways in which Newton's mathematics and physics made sense of the movements of the planets and stars, the daily ebb and flow of the tides, the trajectory of bullets, and of course the falling of apples.

“老实人”只是简单了挖掘了一下牛顿与莱布尼兹在微积分发明上竞争关系的哲学。伏尔泰非常喜爱牛顿，实际上他喜欢所有英国的东西。他在英国待了几年，对那里的言论自由与思想自由印象非常深刻（伏尔泰因为批评天主教会和法国国王而被软禁在家，所以他知道言论自由的重要性）。他非常欣赏牛顿的成就，离开英国后，在法国为普通人写了牛顿思想的通俗版。伏尔泰的书在欧洲有很多读者，欧洲每个人都在讨论牛顿的数学和物理是怎样使行星和星星的运动有意义的，还有日常的潮涨潮落，炮弹的轨道，当然还有苹果的掉落。

Newton gradually acquired his towering reputation because the tools - both mathematical and physical - that he set out in his famous Principia actually worked. These tools helped mathematicians, physicists and astronomers to study a number of problems that Newton had only touched on. No work of science is ever the last word, and so it was with Newton's. Many individuals were happy for Newton to be the giant on whose shoulders they could stand. And in many instances, he did help them see further.

牛顿在著名的《基本原理》中提出的数学和物理工具在实际中得到了应用，他逐渐了成为了灯塔式的人物。这些工具帮助数学家、物理学家和天文学家去研究很多牛顿只是简单接触的问题。没有那个科学工作是最后的工作，牛顿的也不是。很多人都乐于站到牛顿这位巨人的肩膀上，在很多情况下，牛顿都帮助他们看得更远。

Let's look at three examples: the causes of the tides, the shape of the earth, and the number and orbits of the planets in the solar system.

让我们看看三个例子：潮汐的原因，地球的形状，和太阳系中行星的数量和轨道。

There are low and high tides: a low tide is when the sea is 'out' and you have to walk a lot further before you can have a swim, and a high tide is when the sea is 'in' and it's washing away your sandcastles. The tides have a regular, daily pattern, and knowing about them was important for sailors, who might need a high tide to get the ship into harbor. Aristotle had drawn a connection between the tides and the moon. After it became common to believe that the earth actually moves, some compared the tides with the waves you can make in a bucket of water by tilting it to and fro. For Newton, gravity was the key. He argued that the moon's 'gravitational pull' is greatest when the moon is closest to the earth. (Like the earth revolving around the sun, the moon revolves around the earth in an ellipse, so the distances between the earth and moon vary regularly.) The gravity of the moon attracts the water in the oceans towards it. As the earth revolves, an area of sea will become nearer to, and then further away from, the moon, and so the increasing and decreasing force of gravity helps raise and lower the oceans in the regular fashion that we can see. This explains the high and low tides. Newton was right to think that the tides illustrated gravity in action.

有涨潮，有落潮：落潮是大海回去的时候，你需要多走很远才能游泳，涨潮是大海过来的时候，这时候海水会冲掉你的沙堡。潮汐有规则的日常模式，知道这些模式对水手非常重要，他们需要在涨潮的时候将船开进港。亚里士多德将潮汐与月亮联系到了一起。在人们都相信地球确实在运动后，有人将潮汐比作将水桶来回晃的时候产生的波浪。对牛顿来说，重力是解释的关键。他解释说，当月亮里地球最近的时候，其引力最大（就像地球围绕太阳转动，月亮也围绕地球以椭圆轨道转动，所以地球与月亮之间的距离有规则的变化）。月亮的引力将大海中的水吸引过去。当地球转动时，海洋与月亮之间的距离会变的或远或近，引力的增加或减少就会形成我们常见的海洋部分水位的上升或下降。这也就解释了涨潮或落潮。牛顿关于潮汐是引力的表现的观点是正确的。

Later Newtonians refined the master's calculations. The Swiss doctor Daniel Bernoulli (1700-82) offered a closer analysis of tides in 1740. He was much more interested in mathematics, physics and navigation than in medicine, and he also helped explain how strings vibrate (as when you strum a guitar) and how pendulums swing (as in grandfather clocks). He improved the design of ships, too. At the medical school in Basel, he used Newtonian mechanics to look at things such as the way our muscles contract and shorten to make our limbs move. His work on tides was in response to a question set by the Academy of Sciences in Paris, which offered a prize for the best answer - learned societies often did this. Bernoulli shared the prize with several others, each helping to explain why tides behave as they do, and including, in their explanations, the effect of the gravitational pull of the sun as well. When two things, like the earth and the moon, attract each other, the mathematics is relatively simple. In the real world, the sun, planets and other things having mass complicate the picture, and the mathematics becomes much more difficult.

后来的牛顿学说拥护者改善了大师的计算。瑞士医生Daniel Bernoulli (1700-82)在1740年时对潮汐进行了更细致的分析。比起医学，他对数学、物理和导航更感兴趣，他还帮助解释了琴弦是怎么震动的（就像弹吉他的时候）以及钟摆是怎么摆动的（就像老爷钟那样），他还改进了船只的设计。在Basel的医学院的时候，他用牛顿力学的观点来看待事情，比如我们肌肉收缩变短使我们的四肢运动。他关于潮汐的工作是对巴黎科学院设置的问题的回答，巴黎科学院为最好的答案设立了奖赏，学术协会经常这样做。Bernoulli与其他几个人分享了奖励，他们都帮助解释了潮汐的原因，并在解释中包括了太阳的引力作用。当两个物体互相吸引，比如地球和月亮，其数学公式是相对简单的。在真实世界中，太阳、行星和其他有质量的物体使引力变得复杂，其数学公式也变得非常复杂。

The Paris Academy of Sciences was also involved with a second major question of Newtonianism: was the earth a round ball? It was easy to see that it wasn't completely smooth, like a table tennis ball - there were mountains and valleys. But was it basically round? Newton had said no, since he had shown that the force of gravity at the equator was slightly different from the force of gravity in northern Europe. He knew this by experiments with a pendulum. The swing of a pendulum is influenced by the force of the earth's gravity; the stronger the gravity, the faster the pendulum moves, and so it takes a shorter amount of time for it to complete its to-and-fro cycle. Sailors had measured how far the pendulum swung in exactly one second, and the distance was slightly shorter at the equator. This difference told Newton that the distance to the center of the earth was slightly greater at the equator. If the earth were a perfect ball, it would be the same distance everywhere from the surface to the center. Consequently, Newton said that the earth was actually flattened at the poles - as if it had been squashed from top to bottom - and it bulged a bit at the equator. He thought this shape had been created by the earth's rotation on its north-south axis when it was still very new and cooling from its fluid state. Newton hinted that this meant that the earth was older than 6,000 years, but he never revealed how old he thought the earth really was. 

巴黎科学院还非常关心牛顿学说的第二个主要问题：地球是一个圆的球体么？可以很容易看出，地球并不是像乒乓球那样完全平滑的，因为有高山和峡谷，但地球基本是圆的么？牛顿说不是，因为赤道附近的引力与北欧的引力稍有不同。他通过钟摆的实验得到这样的结论，钟摆的摆动受到地球引力的影响，引力越强，摆动越快，完成一个完整的来回摆动需要的时间越短。水手精确的测量了在一秒钟内钟摆所摆动的距离，在赤道那是要短一点的。这个差异告诉牛顿，赤道距地心的距离更远一些。如果地球是个完美的球形，那地表与地心的距离处处应当都是一样的。因此，牛顿说在地球两极更扁平一些，就像从两极受到了挤压一样，在赤道附近有一点膨胀。他认为这是在地球仍是新生的液态冷却的时候，由沿着南北两极的自转形成的。牛顿的说法暗示了地球的年龄超过了6000年，但他从没透露过他认为地球到底有多古老。

When Newton's work was being debated in France during the 1730s, many French scientists refused to believe that the earth had this imperfect shape. So Louis XV, King of France, sent out two expeditions, one to Lapland, near the Arctic Circle, and one to Peru, near the equator - an expensive way to test a simple fact. What the two expeditions did was to measure the precise length of one degree of latitude at these two locations. Latitude is a measure of the north-south axis of the earth, with the equator being zero degrees, the North Pole +90 degrees and the South Pole -90 degrees. (It takes 360 degrees to go around the globe completely.) You can see the lines of latitude drawn from side to side across a map of the world. If the earth were perfectly round, each degree of latitude would be the same. The Lapland expedition returned first (they hadn't had to travel so far) but when the Peru group came back, after nine years, it was shown that the degree of latitude in Lapland was longer than the one in Peru, exactly as predicted by Newton's model. These results helped raise Newton's reputation in continental Europe.

当牛顿的工作在18世纪30年代的法国受到争论时，很多法国科学家拒绝相信地球的形状是不完美的。所以法国国王路易十五排出了两支探险队，一个去北极圈附近的Lapland，一个去了赤道附近的秘鲁，为了验证这个事实花费了巨资。这两支探险队在这两个地方测量了一度纬度的具体距离。纬度是测量南北两极的度量，在赤道附近是0度，北极为+90度，南极为-90度（环绕地球是360度）。你可以在世界地图上看到纬度线从一端画到另一端。如果地球是完美的球形的话，每个纬度应当都是一样的。Lapland探险队首先归来（他们不需要探险很远），但秘鲁探险队9年后才回来，结果发现Lapland处的纬度距离比秘鲁处的要长，就像牛顿模型预测的一样。这些结果使牛顿在欧洲大陆名声鹊起。

Astronomers all over Europe were looking at the stars and planets in an attempt to predict how they moved, and therefore where they would be observed each evening (or each year). These predictions became ever more precise, as more and more observations were done, and as the mathematical analysis of their movements became more accurate. Building bigger telescopes enabled astronomers to see further into space, and then to discover new stars, and even new galaxies. One of the most important of these stargazers was a refugee to England from Germany, William Herschel (1738-1822). Herschel was a musician, but his passion was looking at the heavens. One night, in 1781, he noticed a new object, which was not a star. At first he thought it was probably a comet and he described it to a local group in Bath, where he lived. His observation attracted the attention of others, and it quickly became clear that Herschel had discovered a new planet. It was eventually named Uranus, after a character in Greek mythology.

全欧洲的天文学家都在观察星星和行星，想预测它们怎样运行，这样就可以知道每天晚上在哪里观测到星星（或者是每年）。随着观测结果越来越多，以及其运动的数学分析越来越精确，这些预测也就越来越精确。建造出了更大的望远镜，使天文学家能够看到更远的太空，发现新的星星，甚至新的星系。其中一个最重要的观星者是一名德国到英国的难民，William Herschel (1738-1822)。Herschel是一个音乐家，但他对观察天空非常热情。1781年的一个夜里，他注意到一个新的物体，它并不是个恒星。一开始他认为可能是个彗星，就向他生活的Bath当地团体进行了描述，他的观测吸引了其他人的注意，很快就弄清楚了Herschel发现了一颗新的行星。最终将其命名为天王星，其英文名字是以希腊神话中的一个角色命名的。

This discovery changed Herschel's life and enabled him to devote himself entirely to astronomy. King George III, whose family had also come from Germany, took an interest in Herschel's work. George helped Herschel build the world's largest telescope, and eventually to come to live near Windsor, where one of the royal castles was located. So devoted was Herschel to looking at the heavens, that when he moved to Windsor he arranged his life so that he need not miss a single night's observations. In all his work, Herschel was helped by his sister Caroline (1750-1848), who was also an expert astronomer. Herschel's son John (1792-1871) also continued his father's work, making it a family business.

这个发现改变了Herschel的生活，使他完全献身于天文学之中。国王乔治三世的家庭也来自德国，他对Herschel的工作产生了兴趣。乔治帮助Herschel建造了世界上最大的望远镜，最后来到Windsor附近生活，这里有一座皇家城堡。Herschel对观测天空也非常投入，当他住到Windsor时，他的生活安排使他不会错过每一晚的观测。在他所有工作中，都得到了他的姐姐Caroline (1750-1848)的帮助，她也是一个专业天文学家。Herschel的儿子John (1792-1871)也继续了他父亲的工作，使这成为了家族的工作。

William Herschel not only looked at stars, planets and other heavenly bodies, but he also thought deeply about what he was seeing. Since he had the best telescopes of his time, he could see further. He produced catalogues of stars that were much larger and more accurate than ever before. He realized that our galaxy, the Milky Way, was not the only galaxy in the universe, and he puzzled long and hard about what were called 'nebulae', areas in the sky that appeared as fuzzy white blotches. A few of these can sometimes be seen on a clear night with the naked eye, but Herschel's telescope revealed many more of these blotchy areas. The Milky Way begins to look fuzzy as we peer at its more distant points, and astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply clusters of stars. Herschel showed that some of them probably are, but that others were enormous areas of gaseous clouds swirling around in deep space. In addition, by looking at ‘double stars’, pairs of stars close to each other (well, it's 'close' considering the distances we are talking about), he showed that the behavior of these stars could be explained by gravitational attraction: Newton's gravity was shown to extend even into the outer reaches of space.

Herschel不仅观测星星、行星和其他天体，还对观测结果进行了深入思考，这是因为他有当时最好的望远镜，他可以看的更远。他制作了星星的目录，比所有之前制作的更大、更精确。他意识到我们的星系，银河系，不是宇宙中唯一的星系，他对现在我们称为“星云”的存在长久和艰难的困惑，在天空中它们呈现出模糊的白团。有几个可以在晴朗的夜空中用肉眼看到，但Herschel的望远镜找到了更多的这些团状的区域。当凝视那些远方的点时，银河系看起来就很模糊了，天文学家曾经假设星云就是简单的恒星组成的团。Herschel向大家展示其中一些可能是，但其他的是深空中大片的气体云漩涡。另外，通过观测“双星”，也就是靠得很近的成对的星星（这里的距离近是对比我们现在讨论的距离说的），他展示了这些星星的行为可以用引力解释：牛顿的重力理论延伸到外太空中也可以适用。

Newton's laws of gravity and of motion, along with his mathematical analysis of force (power), acceleration (increasing speed), and inertia (the tendency to keep moving in a straight line), became the guiding principles for natural philosophers during the eighteenth century. No one did more to show how much these principles could explain than the Frenchman, Pierre Simon de Laplace (1749-1827). Laplace worked with Lavoisier, whom we'll meet in Chapter 20, but, unlike his unlucky friend, Laplace came through the French Revolution unharmed. Admired by Napoleon, he was a leading figure in French science for half a century. Laplace used Newton's laws of motion and his mathematical tools to show that the things one could see in the sky could be understood, and that future movements of planets, stars, comets and asteroids could be predicted with accuracy. He developed a theory of how our solar system, with the sun and its planets, could have been born millions of years ago from a vast explosion, with the sun throwing off great chunks of hot gases that gradually cooled to form the planets (and their moons). He called this the 'nebular hypothesis', and he offered some very complicated mathematical calculations to show that it might have happened that way. Laplace was describing a version of what we now call the Big Bang (Chapter 39), although physicists today know a great deal more about this than Laplace could have known.

牛顿的重力定律和运动定律，以及关于力（与能）的数学分析，加速度，惯性（持续在一条直线上运动的趋势），成为了18世纪自然哲学家的指引性原则。法国人Pierre Simon de Laplace (1749-1827)向众人展示了这些原则可以解释的东西之多。Laplace和Lavoisier一起工作，我们在第20章会讲到Lavoisier。和他这位不幸的朋友不一样的是，Laplace经过了法国大革命，但毫发无伤。拿破仑很钦佩他，他在半个世纪内都是法国科学的领导性人物。Laplace用牛顿运动定律和他的数学工具向大家解释，天空上看到的东西是可以解释的，行星、星星、彗星和小行星的未来运动都是可以精确预测的。他发展出一套理论，认为我们的太阳系，包括太阳和它的行星，是在几百万年前的一场巨大爆炸中产生的，太阳甩掉了大块的热气体，在逐渐冷却的过程中形成了行星（以及它们的卫星）。他称之为“星云假说”，他进行了非常复杂的数学计算，以说明确实是可能这样发生的。虽然今天的物理学家知道的比Laplace知道的多的多，可是Laplace的理论就是现代大爆炸学说（第39章）的一个版本。

Laplace was so impressed with the power of Newton's laws of motion that he believed that if we could only know where every particle in the universe was at a given moment, we could predict the running of the whole universe to the ends of time. He realized that it was not possible to do this. What he meant was that the laws of matter and motion were such that the whole universe really did work like a very well-made clock, and that it kept perfect time. His vision of a clockwork universe served scientists for a century after him.

牛顿运动定律让Laplace印象非常深刻，他相信如果知道某一特定时刻宇宙中所有粒子的位置，我们就可以预测整个宇宙的运转，直到时间的终点。他意识到这是不可能做到的，他的意思是物质与运动的定律就是这样的，整个宇宙的运转就像一台制作精良的钟一样，时间精确。他的机械宇宙理论为后来一个世纪的科学家提供了服务。

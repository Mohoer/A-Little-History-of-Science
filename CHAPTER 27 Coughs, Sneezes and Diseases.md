# CHAPTER 27 Coughs, Sneezes and Diseases
# 第27章 咳嗽，喷嚏和疾病

If we have a runny nose, a cough or a stomach upset, we often say we have caught a bug or a virus, by which we mean some kind of germ. The notion of 'catching' something is so natural to us that it is hard to realize how amazing it was when someone came up with a theory that diseases can be caused by germs. Centuries before, doctors had explained that the ills people suffered were due to internal changes in the humours. Even more recently, doctors knew they could blame a bad constitution (we might say 'bad genes'), or too much indulgence in food or drink, or bad habits such as staying up all night. No one had thought that a living organism from the outside could cause a disease. It was a new idea, and it led to a major re-think about what disease itself actually means.

如果我们鼻子流鼻涕，或者咳嗽，或者肚子不舒服，我们经常说我们感染了病毒，意思是说感染了某种细菌。“得了什么病”这种说法非常自然，所以当有人提出一个理论，说疾病是由一些细菌引起的时候，很多人都非常吃惊。几个世纪之前，医生解释说人们得的病是因为身体内部体液的变化。更近一些时候，医生知道可以说成是体质不好（或者说基因不好），或者对饮食的放纵，或者习惯不好，比如夜里很晚不睡觉。没人想过外部的微生物会导致疾病，这是一个新想法，这导致了对疾病本身意义的重新思考。

Doctors in earlier times had certainly talked about the 'seeds' of disease. The word 'virus' was often used too, but it then meant simply 'poison'. People dying from poison, accidental or deliberate, was nothing new. What was new with this theory of germs was that the external source was a tiny, living creature - a micro-organism. It brought with it a language of warfare: the body had 'defenses' against this germ, and could 'fight' infection. Germ theory was a great turning point in medicine.

较早的医生当然也讨论过病根的问题。“病毒”这个词也经常使用，但那时病毒的意思就是简单的“毒物”。人们因为中毒而死亡，或是意外，或是人为，这不是什么新鲜事。细菌这个理论的新鲜之处在于，其外部来源是一种微小的活的生物，微生物。这导致了一种新型战争：身体本身抵御细菌，还可以与感染斗争。细菌理论是在药学中的一个转折点。

We met its most important champion, Louis Pasteur, in the last chapter. He came to germs gradually. He had been busy investigating the role of micro-organisms in many everyday events: the brewing of beer, the fermentation of wine, the baking of bread. The 'pasteurisation' of milk and other dairy products came to rely on discoveries he made: look in your refrigerator and you will see his name used. Pasteurised milk has been heated to just the right temperature, which kills the 'germs' in it. It will last longer and be safer to drink.

我们已经在上一章见过了其最重要的战士，Louis Pasteur，他逐渐转到了细菌上来。他一直忙着调查很多日常事件中微生物的作用：啤酒的酿造，葡萄酒的发酵，面包的烘焙。牛奶以及其他奶制品的“巴氏灭菌法”就是从他的发现中得出的：看看自己的冰箱里，你就会发现用了他的名字。经过巴氏灭菌的牛奶就是将牛奶加热至正确的温度，就可以杀死其中的细菌，这会使奶存放的更久，喝起来更安全。

It was still a big step to show that bacteria, yeast, fungi and other micro-organisms could cause human and animal diseases. It was one thing to see these micro-organisms through a microscope, another thing to show that they and nothing else caused a particular disease. What we now call infectious diseases have always been killers. The bubonic plague, or Black Death, caused high fevers and very painful swellings on the body, known as buboes. It repeatedly swept through British towns and cities for more than 300 years from the 1340s onward. It was spread by fleas that lived on black rats, but moved on to humans when the rats died of plague, too. Smallpox, typhus, scarlet fever, with their skin rashes and high fevers, also took their grim toll. Parents might have eight or more babies and lose most of them to disease while they were still children.

要展示细菌、酵母、真菌和其他微生物会导致人类和动物致病，仍然是很大一步。从显微镜里看到这些微生物是一回事，而要说明是这些微生物、不是别的东西导致了一种特殊的疾病，则是另一回事。我们现在说的传染病一直以来都是杀人凶手。黑死病会导致高烧和身体上痛苦的肿胀，也就是腹股沟淋巴结炎。从14世纪40年代开始，300年里它反复横扫英国的城镇。经由黑老鼠身上的跳蚤传播，但当老鼠死于瘟疫后，传染到了人的身上。天花，斑疹伤寒症，猩红热，这些皮肤都会出疹子，并伴有发烧，也杀死了很多人。父母需要生8个或更多的孩子，因为生病多数孩子还没长大都会死掉。

When doctors studied these diseases, they explained them in one of two ways. Some thought these diseases of whole communities were contagious. That means they were spread from person to person by contact: when a healthy person touched a sick person or a sick person's clothes or sheets. Smallpox, with its horrible spots, seemed to be a contagious disease, especially since people who had not had the disease often came down with it if they nursed a friend or relative.

当医生研究这些疾病的时候，他们会用两种方法解释。一些人认为这些疾病是接触传染的。这意思是疾病通过人与人的接触传播：当健康的人触摸了病人，或病人的衣服或床单。天花，致病者会有可怕的斑点，似乎是一种接触传染性疾病，尤其是没有得过天花的人，如果看护过一位朋友或亲戚，就经常会得这种病。

The spread of other diseases was much less easy to explain by contagion. Doctors had a theory that these diseases were caused by 'miasmas'. A miasma is a foul or unhealthy smell or vapor. Miasmatic diseases happened, they said, because of unhealthy disturbances in the atmosphere: the stench of rotting vegetation and sewage, the bad odors of the sickroom. During the 1800s, cholera was the most feared epidemic disease. It was common in India but in the 1820s it began to spread around the rest of the world. It took six years to travel from India to Britain, where it caused panic because it was a new and very frightening experience. Cholera caused dramatic diarrhoea and vomiting, leaving the poor victim shriveled and in agony, dying an undignified death. It often killed in a day.

其他疾病的传播就没那么容易通过接触传染来解释。医生有一种理论，这些疾病是由瘴气导致的。瘴气是一种污秽或不健康的气味或烟雾。他们说，瘴气病的发生是因为空气中的不健康干扰：腐烂的蔬菜和下水道的恶臭，病房的恶劣味道。在19世纪，霍乱是最恐怖的瘴气传染病，在印度比较常见，但在19世纪20年代，开始传向世界的其他地方。从印度传到英国花了6年，在英国导致了恐慌，因为这是种新的疾病，而且患病经历非常可怕。霍乱导致急剧的腹泻和呕吐，使患者脱水，非常痛苦，死状颇惨，霍乱经常一天内就致死。

Today, international travel helps disease spread very quickly. In those days it made a slower progress. As European doctors and officials watched cholera spread slowly over Asia and Eastern Europe, they could not decide whether it was spreading from person to person (by contagion), or whether this was a miasmatic epidemic. Many people were worried that the disease was spreading through something everyone shared: the air they breathed.

今天，国际旅行帮助了疾病的迅速扩散，而在以前的日子里传播则是很慢的过程。当欧洲医生和官员看着霍乱缓慢的从亚洲传播到东欧时，他们不能确定这是人与人之间接触传染的，又或者这是瘴气性传播的。很多人担心这种病是通过所有人都公用的东西传播的：呼吸的空气。

Depending on which theory they believed, officials could do different things to try to stop disease spreading. If contagion was the cause, then it was best to isolate and quarantine the sufferers. For miasma, cleaning up and improving air quality were important. It was cholera that triggered the most intense debate when it first struck Britain in late 1831. In the panic, medical opinion was divided, but the quarantine measures did not seem to do much good. When the disease came again in 1848 and 1854, a London doctor, John Snow (1813-58), brilliantly worked out what was happening. By talking to local residents, and carefully mapping out each individual case in the neighborhood, he became sure that the cholera was being spread by water from a public pump in Soho, central London. He believed it was contaminated with the feces and vomit of cholera victims, and took a sample to examine by microscope. Although he could not identify any specific cause, his work emphasized that clean water was needed for public health.

根据相信理论的不同，官员们可以做各种不同的事来试图停止疾病的传播。如果是接触传染的，那么最好孤立并隔离患者。如果是瘴气性传播的，打扫干净并改善空气质量是最重要的。当1831年霍乱袭击了英国的时候，这激起了激烈的辩论。在恐慌中，医学意见是分裂的，但隔离措施没有什么用处。当霍乱于1848和1854年再度袭来，一位伦敦医生，John Snow（1813-58），终于搞清楚了疾病发生的情况。通过与当地居民交谈，以及仔细的在地图上标记出邻里间的每个个例，他非常确定霍乱是通过伦敦中心Soho地区的公共水泵的水来传播的。他相信霍乱患者的粪便和呕吐物污染了水源，并带了一份样本，通过显微镜进行检查。尽管他无法识别出任何具体原因，他的工作强调了干净的水是公共健康所必须的。

Snow's research had shown how cholera was spread, not what caused it. For that, the laboratory was crucial, and especially the laboratory of Louis Pasteur. As he continued his research on micro-organisms, the French government asked him to investigate a silkworm disease that was destroying the French silk industry. Pasteur dutifully moved with his family to the south of France, where silk was being produced. He put his wife and children to work with him on trying to identify the cause of the problem. It turned out to be a micro-organism that was infecting the silkworm larvae. By showing how it could be avoided, Pasteur saved the French silk industry.

Snow的研究证实了霍乱的扩散方式，而并不是导致霍乱的起源。为了研究这个，实验室是非常重要的，尤其是Louis Pasteur的实验室。既然他一直在继续研究微生物，法国政府请求他调查一种正在摧毁法国蚕丝业的桑蚕疾病。Pasteur很负责人的与家人一起搬到了法国南部，也就是蚕丝生产地。他让妻子和孩子与他一同工作，鉴定问题的原因。结果是一种微生物感染了桑蚕幼体。Pasteur告诉了人们怎样防止这种情况，从而拯救了法国蚕丝业。

This put Pasteur on the disease trail. He wanted to demonstrate his belief that micro-organisms cause many of the diseases from which human beings and animals suffer. He began with anthrax, a disease of farm animals that was sometimes passed to humans. Until recently, this disease was largely forgotten, although it's one that terrorists now threaten us with. It causes nasty sores of the skin and, if it spreads to the bloodstream, it can kill. It is caused by a large bacterium, so it is relatively easy to detect. Anthrax was to become the first human disease Pasteur was able to prevent by making a vaccine.

这将Pasteur进入了疾病的道上。他想证明他所坚信的东西，也就是微生物会导致很多人类和动物为之受苦的疾病。他从炭疽病开始，一种农场动物的疾病，有时候会传染给人。这种病被遗忘了很久，直到最近恐怖分子开始用来恐吓我们。它会导致皮肤难受的疮疡，如果扩散到血流中，可以杀死人。这是一种较大的细菌导致的，所以相对来说容易检测到。炭疽病是第一种Pasteur通过制造疫苗来防止的人类疾病。

Back in 1796, Edward Jenner (1749-1823), an English country doctor, had found a way to prevent smallpox by deliberately injecting a boy with cowpox, a similar but much milder disease. Cowpox was a disease of cows that milkmaids sometimes got, and it had been observed that these girls seemed to be protected from the more dangerous smallpox. Jenner called his new procedure vaccination (from the Latin word for cow, vacca), and vaccination programs were started in many countries. They helped make this serious disease much less common.

回到1796年，Edward Jenner (1749-1823)，一个英国乡村医生，找到了一种预防天花的方法，就是故意给一个男孩注射牛痘，牛痘是一种类似的但温和的多的疾病。牛痘是牛的一种疾病，挤奶的女工有时候会得这种病，而且人们观察到，这些女孩似乎不受这种危险的多的天花的影响。Jenner称这种新手续为种痘（从拉丁文的牛字中演化出来），而且在很多国家都开始了种痘的项目。这使得这种危险的疾病少见的多了。

Pasteur wanted to do something similar for anthrax, but there was no closely related disease around. Instead, he learned how to make the anthrax bacterium weaker, by changing its living conditions, such as the temperature, altering the food it could use, or exposing it to the air. Bacteria need the right conditions to flourish, just as we do. Pasteur succeeded in making his anthrax bacteria much less able to cause disease, and he called these weakened bacteria a vaccine, in honor of Jenner. Then he invited newspaper reporters to witness an experiment. Having injected some sheep and cattle with his vaccine, he gave the anthrax bacteria to that group, and to another. The experiment was an outstanding success: the animals he had vaccinated were unaffected when given the bacteria, whereas the unprotected animals died of the disease. Pasteur had made the world conscious of the power of medical science.

Pasteur希望为炭疽病做一些类似的事，但周围没有找到紧密联系的疾病。他反而通过改变炭疽细菌的生存环境，比如温度，改变它的食物，或者将其暴露在空气中，使其变得更弱一些。细菌需要适当的环境才能旺盛活跃，就像我们一样。Pasteur成功的将炭疽细菌的致病性大大降低，他称这种弱化的细菌为疫苗，以向Jenner表示敬意。然后他邀请报纸记者见证一场实验，将他的疫苗注射给一些羊和牛后，他将炭疽细菌投到了这个群体中，还投到了另外一个群体中。实验是一个显著的成功：接种了疫苗的动物没有被细菌影响，而未受保护的那些动物死于炭疽病。Pasteur使这个世界意识到医学科学的力量。

After anthrax came rabies. Rabies is a horrible disease, generally caused by a bite from an infected animal. It is often fatal, and its victims - including many young children - foam at the mouth and can't even drink water. The remarkable thing about Pasteur and rabies is that he could not even see what he was dealing with. The virus that causes rabies is so small that the microscopes available to Pasteur and his contemporaries could not bring it into focus. However, Pasteur knew from the victims' symptoms that whatever was causing rabies was attacking the brain and spinal cord, at the center of the nervous system. So he used the spinal cord of rabbits to 'culture' (grow) the virus artificially. He could make it more, or less, harmful, according to the conditions under which he cultured it. He used his weaker virus to make a vaccine. His first human case was a dramatic success and made Pasteur a worldwide name. Joseph Meister was a young boy who had been bitten by a rabid dog. His desperate parents brought him to Pasteur, who agreed to try to save his life by a series of injections. Pasteur was a chemist, so a doctor actually had to give the injections, but the vaccination was a triumph. Young Meister survived, and worked for Pasteur for the rest of his life. Other people bitten by rabid animals hurried to Paris to receive this new miracle cure. The successful treatment created an international sensation, and people donated money to start a Pasteur Institute, where Pasteur worked until he died. The Institute is still going strong, more than a century later.

炭疽病之后是狂犬病。狂犬病是一种可怕的疾病，一般由被感染的动物的咬伤导致，通常是致命的，其受害者包括很多孩子，口吐白沫，甚至不能喝水。Pasteur和狂犬病的故事的精彩之处在于他甚至看不到他处理的对象。导致狂犬病的病毒太小了，Pasteur及其同龄人能用的显微镜都看不到病毒。但是，Pasteur从受害者的症状了解到，无论导致狂犬病的是什么，都是正在攻击大脑和脊髓，也就是神经系统的中心。所以他用兔子的脊髓来人工培养这种病毒。根据他培养环境的不同，他可以使病毒更加有害，或者更加无害，他使用了较弱的病毒制作疫苗。他的第一例人类实验非常成功，使Pasteur闻名世界。Joseph Meister是一个年轻的小男孩，他被一只患病的狗咬了，他绝望的父母将他带到了Pasteur这里，Pasteur同意通过一系列注射来挽救他的生命。Pasteur是一个化学家，所以实际上是一个医生来给小孩注射，但这次疫苗接种是一次胜利。年轻的Meister活了下来，他的余生都在为Pasteur工作。其他被狂暴动物咬了的人也都赶到巴黎接受这种奇迹的治疗。成功的治疗创造了国际性的大轰动，人们捐款成立了Pasteur研究院，他在这里一直工作到去世。这个研究所在一百多年后的今天仍然在良好的运行。

Pasteur was always unusual, both in his outstanding successes and in the ways he grew and studied his micro-organisms. Other scientists found his methods clumsy and difficult. Many of the laboratory tools that scientists still use to study bacteria were developed by Pasteur's German rival, Robert Koch (1843-1910). Unlike Pasteur, Koch was a doctor, who began his work while treating patients. He, too, worked on anthrax, that bacterium that was easy to see. He worked out how anthrax moves from animals to humans and discovered that it has a complicated life-cycle. Sometimes the anthrax bacteria go into a kind of hibernation, known as the ‘spore phase’. These spores are very hard to kill and they too can infect humans and animals so that they develop the disease in more than one way. Even though bacteria consist of only one cell, it turns out they are very complicated organisms.

Pasteur一直都很不寻常，一方面是他杰出的成功，另一方面是他培养和研究他的微生物。其他科学家认为他的方法笨拙又困难。今天的科学家仍然用于研究细菌的实验室工具是由其德国竞争对手，Robert Koch (1843-1910)，研制发展出来的。和Pasteur不一样，Koch是一个医生，一边工作一边治疗病人。他也研究过炭疽细菌，这种细菌很容易就观察到。他弄懂了炭疽细菌是如何从动物运动到人体的，发现了这种细菌有其复杂的生命循环。有时候炭疽细菌会进入休眠，被称为“孢子时期”。这些孢子很难杀死，它们也能感染人类和动物，所以其致病方式不止一种。即使细菌只包含一个细胞，结果发现它们也是非常复杂的微生物。

Koch pioneered the use of photography to make a visible record of bacteria that cause disease. He grew his bacteria on a solid kind of jelly called agar-agar: this allowed individual 'colonies' (groups of bacteria) to be identified and studied. It was much less messy than Pasteur's flasks and soups. One of Koch's assistants, named Petri, invented the little dish used to hold the agar and grow the bacteria. Koch also appreciated the use of colored stains to help identify different bacteria. These developments changed the face of bacteriology, and helped the international group of doctors and scientists begin to make sense of these tiny organisms.

Koch最先使用照相术使致病细菌的记录可视化。他在一种称为琼脂的固体胶状物上培养细菌，这使单个细菌群得以鉴别和研究。这比Pasteur的烧瓶和困境简单多了。Koch的一个助理，名叫Petri，发明了用来装琼脂培养细菌的小盘。Koch还非常赞成使用有色的染色剂来帮助鉴别不同的细菌。这些发展改变了细菌学的面貌，帮助国际上的医生群体和科学家群体开始搞清这些微小的生物的意思。

Koch was a 'microbe hunter'. ('Microbe' is just short for micro-organism.) He identified the germs that caused two of the most important diseases of the nineteenth century. In 1882, he announced his discovery of the tubercle bacillus, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. Tuberculosis killed more people than any other disease in the nineteenth century, but doctors thought it was either inherited, or the result of an unhealthy lifestyle. Koch's research showed that tuberculosis is an infectious disease, spread from a sick individual to another person. It differed from other epidemic diseases such as influenza, measles, typhus and cholera, because it is a slow disease - slow to spread and infect, and slow to kill. Tuberculosis usually destroys the lungs over a number of years.

Koch是一个微生物猎人。他鉴别出19世纪两种重要疾病的致病菌。1882年，他宣布他发现了结核菌，也就是导致肺结核的细菌。19世纪时，肺结核的死亡率最高，但医生认为这要么是遗传的，要么是因为生活方式不健康。Koch的研究证明了肺结核是一种传染性疾病，从一个病人传到另一个人。它与其他流行性传染病不同，比如流感、风疹、斑疹伤寒症、霍乱，因为这是一种慢性病，传播和感染的都很慢，致死也很慢。肺结核会在几年内摧毁人的肺部。

Koch's second great find was the bacterium that causes cholera, that other most feared disease. When it appeared in 1883 in Egypt, the French and the Germans sent scientists to see if they could uncover its cause. It was a kind of competition. One of the French team caught the disease and died. (Pasteur had wanted to go but was too frail.) Koch and his German colleagues thought they might have found the right germ, but they could not be sure. So Koch went on to India, where cholera was then always present. In identifying the cholera bacillus, he showed that Snow had been right - it was something in the water after all. He found the bacillus both in the diarrhoea of its victims, and in the wells from which they drew their water. Understanding the cause of infectious diseases paved the way for better control and, eventually, for vaccines, which have saved countless millions of lives over the past century.

Koch的第二个伟大发现是霍乱的致病菌，这是另一种最为害怕的疾病。当1883年这种病第一次在埃及出现时，法国和德国派遣科学家去看看能否揭开其原因。这种一种竞争，法国队伍中的一人传染了病，死去了（Pasteur本来想去的，但是他太虚弱了）。Koch和他的德国同事认为他们可能发现了正确的病菌，但不是非常确定。所以Koch去了印度，那里总是有霍乱。在鉴别霍乱杆菌的过程中，他证实了Snow是正确的，这终究是水里的东西。他在受害者的腹泻物中找到了细菌，也在抽水的井中找到了细菌。理解了这种传染病的致病源，为更好的控制最终接种疫苗铺平了道路，疫苗在过去的这个世纪中拯救了无数人的性命。

From the late 1870s, many disease-causing germs were correctly identified (and many were announced that were later shown not to be dangerous at all). It was an exciting period, and a lot of doctors thought it heralded a new dawn for medicine and hygiene. It showed the importance of clean water, milk and everything else we eat and drink. From then on, doctors have advised us to wash our hands after using the toilet, and to cover our mouth when we cough. Identifying germs meant that scientists could make vaccines and, later, drugs. And it made modern surgery possible.

从19世纪70年代开始，许多致病菌都被正确的鉴别了出来（很多后来证实并宣布其实一点都不危险）。这是一个令人兴奋的时期，很多医生认为这预示着医学和卫生学的新的黎明的到来。这证实了干净的水、牛奶和其他我们食用饮用的所有东西的重要性。从那时候开始，医生开始建议我们，便后要洗手，咳嗽的时候要掩住嘴巴。鉴别病菌意味着科学家可以制作疫苗，接下来，制作药物，这也使得现代外科手术得以可能。

As early as the 1860s, the English surgeon Joseph Lister (1827-1912) had been inspired by Pasteur's germs. He introduced what he called antiseptic surgery. You probably have some antiseptic cream in your first aid kit. Lister's new method involved carbolic acid, also known as phenol, which was used to disinfect sewage. He would use carbolic acid to wash his surgical instruments and the bandages he would put over the body where it had been cut. He later invented a device to spray carbolic acid over the patient's body and the surgeon's hands during the operation. When Lister compared his patients with those of surgeons not using his 'Listerian' methods, or with his own pre-Listerian patients, he found that many more had survived their operation. They had not died from infections that started at the site of the operation and spread in the blood. In his experiments to disprove spontaneous generation, Pasteur had shown that 'germs' were carried through the air on particles of dust. Lister was killing these germs with his carbolic acid routine.

早在19世纪60年代，英国外科医生Joseph Lister (1827-1912)就被Pasteur的病菌所启发，他引入了他称之为抗菌外科手术的东西。在你的急救药箱中很可能就有抗菌药膏。Lister的新方法中包括石碳酸，用来给污物消毒。他用石碳酸清洗手术用具和绷带，然后将绷带绑到身体受伤的部位。后来他发明了一种装置，可以在手术中将石碳酸喷射到病人身体上和外科医生的手上。当Lister将他的病人与那些没有使用Lister方法的病人，或者与他使用Lister方法之前的病人相比，他发现病人治愈率明显提高了。手术地点就有很多感染，还会传播进入血液，使用Lister方法的病人并没有因为这个死去。在Pasteur反驳自然生产的实验中，他已经证实了病菌是由空气中的灰尘微粒带来的，Lister正在使用石碳酸法杀死这些病菌。

Just as he had improved on Pasteur's laboratory tools, so Robert Koch would advance Lister's antiseptic surgery. Lister had aimed to kill any disease-causing germs in the wound. Koch's aseptic surgery would prevent them getting into the wound in the first place. Koch invented the autoclave, a device that used very hot steam to sterilize surgical instruments. Aseptic surgery allowed surgeons to safely enter the body cavities (the chest, abdomen and brain) for the first time. It gradually brought about our modern operating theatre, with its surgical gowns and masks, rubber gloves and sterile equipment.

Koch改进了Pasteur的实验室工具，他还使Lister的抗菌外科手术更进一步。Lister的目标是杀死任何伤口处的致病菌。Koch的无菌外科手术首先就预防了病菌进入伤口。Koch发明了高压灭菌器，这种装置用非常热的蒸汽对外科手术器械进行杀菌。无菌外科手术使外科医生第一次安全的进入身体的腔体中（胸腔，腹腔和脑腔），逐渐的形成了我们现代的手术室，包括手术衣，手术面罩，手术橡胶手套和无菌设备。

Along with modern hygiene, surgery could not have advanced without anesthesia. It had been introduced into medicine in the 1840s, in America. Anesthesia was a triumph for chemistry in the service of medicine, since the compounds that were shown to put people to sleep - ether and chloroform - were chemicals made in the laboratory. (Humphry Davy's nitrous oxide was another early anesthetic.) The removal of agonizing pain, and sometimes death, from surgery and childbirth seemed nothing short of miraculous. One of its British pioneers was John Snow, of cholera fame. Snow's anesthetic career peaked when he gave anesthesia to Queen Victoria, during the birth of her last two children. The Queen, who had had seven babies already without anesthesia, thought it was a jolly good thing.

没有麻醉，现代卫生学和手术都得不到进步。麻醉在19世纪40年代的美国被引入到医学中。麻醉是化学为医学服务的胜利，因为这种能使人沉睡的化合物，乙醚和氯仿，是实验室中制作出来的化学品（Humphry Davy的一氧化氮是另一种早期麻醉剂）。手术和生孩子过程中的痛苦难忍的疼痛，有时候甚至是死亡，都被去除了，这简直就和奇迹一样。英国的一位麻醉先驱是John Snow，成名于霍乱。Snow的麻醉事业达到最高峰的时候是，他为维多利亚女王生最后两个孩子的时候实施麻醉。女王生了7个孩子都没有麻醉，当然这是件好事。

Understanding germs helped make advanced surgery possible. It also offered doctors ways to understand the infectious diseases which had caused so much pain and death throughout human history. There was now a scientific basis for Edward Jenner's discovery of vaccination to protect against specific diseases. These injections are worth it, even if they hurt at the time, for they offer hope that if everyone is vaccinated, many infectious diseases can be conquered. We know a lot more about germs than at the time of Pasteur and Koch. And we are more aware, as Chapter 36 will tell, how adaptable and slippery they are, these bacteria, viruses and parasites. They have been able to adapt to the medicines and treatments that doctors aim at them, and to become resistant - a lesson in Darwinian evolution. They survive because they adapt, a lesson that Darwin first taught.

理解病菌使手术进步成为可能。这也使医生可以理解那些在人类历史上导致了如此多痛苦和死亡的传染病。现在Edward Jenner的免受特定疾病的疫苗接种有了科学基础。这些注射是值得的，即使注射时有点痛，因为如果每个人都接种疫苗，很多传染病就有了被征服的可能。我们现在比Pasteur和Koch时代更加了解病菌，我们将在第36章了解到，这些细菌、病毒和寄生虫适应能力有多强，有多么狡猾。它们能适应药物以及医生的治疗，变得有抗药性，Darwin的进化理论也适用于它们。它们生存，因为它们能适应，这是Darwin最开始就教给我们的一课。

# CHAPTER 30 Into the Atom
# 第30章 进入原子之内

The chemists liked the atom. It was what entered into chemical reactions. It had definite positions within compounds. It had properties that were roughly defined by its place on the periodic table. Each atom had its tendency to be either negative or positive in its relationships with other atoms, and to have the joining patterns called valence. Chemists also appreciated the difference between a single atom and the grouping of atoms into molecules (collections of atoms bound together). They realized that whereas most were happy to exist as single atoms, some atoms - hydrogen and oxygen, for instance- naturally existed in the molecular form (H2 or O2). Atoms' relative weights, with hydrogen always as 1, were also measured with increasing accuracy.

化学家喜欢原子。原子进入到化学反应中，在化合物内有着确切的位置，其性质基本在元素周期表上的位置确定。每个原子在与其他原子反应时，有着固定的倾向，变成带正电的原子或带负电的原子，也有固定的连接模式，称为原子价。科学家也还可以鉴别一个原子与一个分子中的原子聚集之间的区别，他们意识到有些原子可以以单原子的方式存在，但有些原子天生就是以分子的形式存在的，比如氢气H2和氧气O2。以氢原子的相对质量是1为计，原子的相对重量也得到越来越精确的测量。

Yet none of this gave chemists much clue about the finer structures of atoms. They found they could manipulate atoms in their laboratories, but could not say much about what these units of matter actually were.

但这些都与原子内部的结构无关，化学家们可以在实验室内针对原子做实验，但说不出原子到底是什么东西。

For much of the nineteenth century, physicists were rather more interested in other things: how energy was conserved, how electricity and magnetism could be measured, the nature of heat, and why gases behaved as they did. The physicists' theory of gases - called the kinetic theory - also involved thinking about atoms and molecules. But physicists, like chemists, agreed that although atomic theory was extremely useful in explaining what they saw and measured, the real nature of atoms was difficult to understand.

19世纪的大部分时间里，物理学家们只是对这些事情感兴趣：能量怎么保存，电力和磁力怎样测量，热量的本性，以及气体行为的原因。物理学家关于气体的理论，称为动力学，和原子与分子的思想有关。但物理学家和化学家一样，承认原子理论在解释所看到及测量到的东西时非常有用，但原子真正的内在本质很难理解。

The first sign that atoms were not simply the smallest unit of matter came with the momentous discovery of one of its components, the electron. Experiments had already shown that atoms could possess electric charges, because electric currents in a solution attracted some atoms to the positive and others to the negative pole. Physicists were not so sure that an atom's electrical properties played any part in chemical reactions. But they measured their electrical charges and found they came in definite units. These units had been named 'electrons' in 1894, just after J.J. Thomson (1856-1940) in Cambridge began to use the cathode tube in his experimental work.

原子并不是物质最小的单位的第一个迹象是电子的重要发现。有实验已经证实原子可以带电，因为溶液中的电流会将一部分原子吸引到正极，一部分吸引到负极。物理学家不是很确定一个原子的带电特性会在化学反应中起什么作用，但他们测量了带电量，发现是确切数目的单位。这个单位在1894年被命名为电子，在这之后，剑桥的J.J. Thomson(1856-1940)开始在实验中使用阴极管。

The cathode tube is quite simple. It is amazing, really, that something so simple could begin to tell us about the fundamental structure of the atom and the universe. This tube has had most of the air sucked out to create a partial vacuum, and electrodes have been inserted at each end. When an electric current is sent though the tube, all sorts of interesting things happen, including the production of rays (radiations). Radiations are streams of energy or particles, and those made in the cathode tube consisted mostly of fast-moving, charged particles. Thomson and his colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratories began to measure the electrical charge and the weight of some of these radiations. They tried to decide how these two measurements were related to each other. In 1897 Thomson proposed that these rays were streams of charged sub-atomic particles: bits of the atoms. He estimated that they weighed only a tiny fraction of the lightest atom, hydrogen. It took physicists several years to agree that Thomson had indeed found the electron - and that it was the unit of charge that he and others had been measuring for some time.

阴极管非常简单，也非常美妙，这样简单的东西可以告诉我们原子和宇宙的结构。阴极管中大部分空气都被抽出来，形成一个半真空的环境，两侧被插入了电极。当管子上有了电流，会发生很多有趣的事，包括产生射线（辐射）。辐射就是能量束或粒子束，阴极管中的主要包括高速运动的带电粒子。Thomson和他Cavendish实验室的同事开始测量这些电荷和这些辐射的质量，他们试着看看这两者之间有什么关系。在1897年，Thomson提出这些射线是带电的亚原子粒子束，也就是原子的一部分。他估算出它们只是最轻的原子，氢原子的很小一部分。物理学家花了几年才同意这个观点，也就是Thomson真的发现了电子，这就是他和其他人测量了很久的电荷的单位。

So, atoms have electrons. What else do they have? The answer came gradually, from the results of more experiments with the cathode tube. The vacuums within the tube became better, and stronger electric currents could be passed through. Among those who exploited these technical advances was Thomson's one-time student, collaborator and eventual successor at the Cavendish Laboratories in Cambridge, the New Zealander Ernest Rutherford(1873-1937). In the late 1890s Rutherford and Thomson identified two different kinds of rays given off by uranium, an element that had acquired great importance for physicists.

所以，原子内含有电子，还有什么别的呢？随着阴极管的更多实验，答案逐渐出现。阴极管的真空程度越来越高，通过的电流也越来越强。有一个继续发掘这些科技进展的人曾经是Thomson的学生，合作者，最后成为了他在剑桥Cavendish实验室的继承人，新西兰的Ernest Rutherford（1873-1937）。在19世纪90年代后期，Rutherford和Thomson识别了铀（对物理学家而言非常重要的元素）放射出的两种不同射线。

One of the uranium rays could be bent in a magnetic field; the other could not. Not knowing what they were, Rutherford called them simply 'alpha' and 'beta' rays - just 'A' and 'B' in Greek. The names stuck. Rutherford continued to experiment with both strange rays for decades. It turned out that not just uranium, but a whole group of elements, gave off (emitted) these rays. These elements created great excitement in the early years of the twentieth century, and they remain very important today. They are the 'radioactive' elements, and uranium, radium and thorium occur most commonly. When scientists began to investigate their special properties, they learned crucial things about atomic structure.

其中一种铀射线可以被磁场弯曲，另一种则不可以。既然不知道这些射线是什么，Rutherford称之为α射线和β射线，也就是希腊语中的A和B，名字流传了下来。Rutherford对这两种射线实验了数十年，结果发现不只是铀，但一系列元素都可以发射出这种射线。在20世纪初，这些元素造成了巨大的轰动，而且现在仍然很重要。它们就是放射性元素，铀、镭、钍最为常见。当科学家开始研究它们的特殊性质，他们发现了有关原子结构的关键事情。

The alpha 'ray' was fundamental. (It is also called the alpha 'particle' - the distinctions sometimes blur in the very small and very fast world of atomic physics.) Rutherford and his colleagues aimed them at very thin sheets of metals, measuring what happened. Normally, the particles passed through the metal sheets. But occasionally, they bounced straight back. Imagine Rutherford's surprise when he considered what had happened. It was as if he had fired a heavy cannon-ball into a sheet of paper and discovered that it had bounced right back at him. What the experiment meant was that the alpha particle had encountered a very dense part of the atoms that were making up the metal sheet. This dense area was the nucleus of the atom. His experiments showed that atoms consist mostly of empty space, and that was why most of the alpha particles passed straight through. It was only when they hit the highly concentrated mass in this central nucleus that they bounced back. More work showed that the nucleus is positively charged. Physicists began to suspect that the nucleus's positive charge is balanced by the electron's negative charges, and that the electrons circle around in the largely empty space surrounding the nucleus.

α射线是基本的（也称为α粒子，在又小又快的原子物理领域，这种区别非常模糊）。Rutherford和他的同事将其对准了金属薄片，测量发生的情况。正常来说，粒子会穿过薄片，但偶尔也会反射回来。想象一下Rutherford的惊讶状况，这就像他向一张纸片发射了一记重炮，但发现炮弹向他反射了回来。实验意味着α粒子遇到了构成金属的原子的非常致密部分，这个致密的部分就是原子的原子核。这个实验说明了，原子大部分是空的，这也是为什么α粒子可以直接通过，只有当其轰击到原子核时，才会反射回来。后续的实验证明了原子核是带正电的。物理学家开始猜测原子核的正电荷为电子的负电荷所平衡，电子在原子核周围的巨大空间中环绕运动。

Rutherford is now considered the founder of nuclear physics. In 1908 he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discoveries. These prizes were named after their Swedish founder. They became the highest accolade in science after their introduction in 1901, and winning one remains the goal of many ambitious scientists. Rutherford was good at finding outstanding students and colleagues, and several of them won Nobel Prizes too.

Rutherford现在被认为是核物理学得奠基人。由于他的发现，在1908年他获得了诺贝尔化学奖。这个奖项以其瑞典创始人命名，在1901年设立后，后来成为科学领域的最高荣誉，能够获一个奖是很多有雄心的科学家的目标。Rutherford善于发现杰出的学生和同事，好几个也获得了诺贝尔奖。

Niels Bohr (1885-1962) from Denmark was one of these. He took Rutherford's idea that the atom's mass is almost all squeezed into its small nucleus and applied an exciting new tool called 'quantum' physics to develop something called the 'Bohr atom' in 1913. This was a model visualizing what was going on inside the atom, using the best information scientists had at the time. It imagined that an atom had a structure something like our solar system, with the sun/nucleus in the middle and the planets/electrons spinning around it in their orbits. In Bohr's model, the weight of the positively charged nucleus gave the atom its atomic weight, and therefore its place in the periodic table. The nucleus was made up of positively-charged protons. The heavier the atom, the more protons were in the nucleus. The number of protons and electrons had to match so that the atom as a whole is electrically neutral. The electrons swirled around the nucleus in different orbits and this was where the 'quantum' bit came in. One of the brilliant parts of the whole package of ideas that scientists called 'quantum physics' was the idea that things in nature come in definite, individual packets ('quanta'). (The story of the quantum comes in Chapter 32.) The things can be mass, energy or whatever you are interested in. In the Bohr model, the electrons orbit in different, individual quantum states. The electrons nearest the nucleus are more strongly attracted to it. Those furthest away are the less strongly bound and it is these electrons that are available to participate in chemical reactions or to generate electricity or magnetism.

丹麦的Niels Bohr（1885-1962）就是其中一个人。他接受了Rutherford的观点，原子的质量几乎都被压缩在小小的原子核中，然后1913年用了一种新工具，“量子”物理来建立称之为Bohr原子的模型。这种模型利用了当时科学家知道的最好的信息，告诉了人们原子内部发生的事情。模型假设原子的结构类似于太阳系的结构，也就是太阳/原子核在中央，行星/电子围绕其在轨道上转动。在Bohr模型中，带正电荷的原子核的质量就是原子的质量，也就是在元素周期表上的位置。原子核由带正电荷的质子组成，原子越重，原子核中的质子越多。质子和电子的数量要匹配，所以原子整体才能是不带电的。在不同轨道上围绕原子核旋转的电子是量子力学用到的地方。科学家称之为“量子力学”的观点的精彩之处在于东西本身是确定的，由独立的单位组成的（“量子”）。（量子的故事在第32章）这些东西可以是物质、能量或你所感兴趣的东西。在Bohr模型中，电子在不同的独立的量子态轨道运行。最接近原子核的电子受到的吸附力越大。距离最远的电子受到的束缚越少，就是这些电子可以参与化学反应，或者产生电或磁的现象。

If this all seems rather difficult - well, it is. Bohr knew that. But he also knew that his Bohr model allowed physicists and chemists to talk in the same language. It was grounded on experiments by physicists, but also went far in explaining what the chemists observed in their own laboratories. In particular, it helped explain why elements in the periodic table behaved as they did, with their differing joining patterns, or valence. Those that joined singly did so because they had only one 'free' electron. Others had different patterns because of the number of 'free' electrons they had. His model of the atom has become one of the modern icons of science, even if we know now that the atom is much more complicated even than Bohr thought.

如果这一些看起来都很难，确实也是这样的，Bohr也知道，但他也知道，Bohr模型使物理学家和化学家可以在相同的话语体系中对话。这是基于物理学家的实验得到的结果，但也可以解释化学家实验室中观察到的现象。特别是它可以帮助解释元素周期表中的元素行为的原因，为什么元素们会这样结合，元素们的原子价为什么是这样的。一个一个结合在一起的是因为它们只有一个自由电子，其他结合模式的数目不同是因为其自由电子数不同。其原子模型已经成为现代科学的标志，即使我们现在知道原子的模型比Bohr想象的要复杂的多。

All sorts of new questions arose. First, how is it that the positively-charged protons can co-exist in the tight space that is the atomic nucleus? With electric charge, like repels like, and opposites attract (think of two magnets). So why don't the protons push each other apart, and why don't the electrons get sucked in? Second, the lightest known atom was hydrogen, so let's assume that hydrogen, with its atomic weight of 1, consists of a single proton and an almost weightless electron. That means it's reasonable to assume that the proton has an atomic weight of 1. So why don't the atomic weights of the atoms in the periodic table simply go up in a nice steady flow: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on?

各种问题出现了。第一，带正电荷的质子在原子核如此紧密的空间中如何共存的？带电粒子同性相斥，异性相吸（想象一下两个磁极）。所以为什么质子们不是互相推开彼此，而电子们不被吸收到原子核中呢？第二，最轻的原子是氢，那我们假设氢原子质量为1，包括一个质子和一个几乎没有质量的电子，那就意味着可以假设质子的质量为1，那为什么元素周期表中的原子质量不是以1,2,3,4,5这样的方式增加的呢？

An answer to the first puzzle had to wait until quantum mechanics was further developed. The second puzzle, about skips in the sequence of atomic weights, was solved much sooner, by another of Rutherford's Cambridge colleagues, James Chadwick(1891-1974). In 1932, Chadwick announced the results of his bombarding experiments. Ever since Rutherford, this method had been a vital tool for physicists at work on the structure of the atom. Chadwick had been sending streams of alpha particles at his favorite metal, beryllium. He found that beryllium sometimes emitted a particle with an atomic weight of one, and no charge. He used Rutherford's name for the particle - the neutron - but it soon became clear that it was not simply a proton and electron combined, as Rutherford had thought, but a fundamental particle of nature. The neutron was a kind of missing link for physicists, explaining puzzling atomic weights and positions in the periodic table. Mendeleev's representation of the earth's elements was continuing to prove its worth in charting the basic materials of our planet. Chadwick's neutron also led to the discovery of isotopes. Sometimes atoms of the same element have different atomic weights - if they have a different number of neutrons, which are these neutral particles in the atom's nucleus. Isotopes are thus atoms of the same element with different atomic weights. Even hydrogen can occasionally have an atomic weight of 2 instead of 1, when it has a neutron along with its single proton. Chadwick won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of neutrons and what they could do, only three years after he discovered them.

第一个问题直到量子力学有了进一步发展后才有答案。第二个问题，原子质量的跳跃性顺序，很快就有了答案。回答的人是Rutherford的另一个剑桥同事，James Chadwick（1891-1974）。在1932年，Chadwick宣布了他的轰击实验结果。自从Rutherford以后，这种方法就是物理学家研究原子结构的关键工具。Chadwick朝他最喜爱的金属，铍，发射α粒子束。他发现铍有时候会发射出一种不带电的质量为1的粒子。他以Rutherford的名字命名为中子，但很快就发现这不是Rutherford想象的质子和电子的组合，而是一种基本粒子。中子对于物理学家来说就是那“缺失的一环”，可以解释元素奇怪的质量和其在元素周期表上的位置。Mendeleev所列出的地球上的元素表又可以继续发挥作用了。Chadwick发现的中子也导致了同位素的发现。有时候同一元素的原子有着不同的原子重量，这是因为含有不同数目的中子，这些中子就是原子核中的中性粒子。因此，同位素就是同一元素具有不同质量的原子。即使是氢，有时候重量也是2，而不是1，这时候有一个中子和质子一起。Chadwick发现中子及其作用3年后，就获得了诺贝尔奖。

The neutron was a powerful tool for bombarding the nuclei of other atoms. Lacking either a positive or negative charge, it isn't naturally repulsed by the heavily positive atomic nucleus, with its tightly packed protons. Chadwick recognized this, and saw that if you were going to smash atoms, you needed a machine that could accelerate them to high speeds and energies: a cyclotron or a synchrotron. These use very strong magnetic fields to propel atoms and their particles almost as fast as light. To do this kind of research, Chadwick left Cambridge for the University of Liverpool, because there he was given funds to build a cyclotron. There he saw that smashing high-speed neutrons into heavy atoms, such as uranium, could generate terrific energies. If such energies were harnessed, they could start a chain reaction leading to a momentous outcome: atomic 'fission', the splitting of the atom. The atomic bombs that were made and used to end the Second World War were the result of this work, and Chadwick was the leader of the British side of this project.

中子是轰击其他原子的原子核的强力工具。由于既不带正电，也不带负电，它不会被包含紧密排列质子的原子核的排斥。Chadwick意识到了这一点，也预见了，如果想用中子轰击原子，那就需要一台机器使其加速到非常高的速度，拥有很高的能量，这种机器就是回旋加速器或同步加速器。这些机器用非常强的磁场使原子及粒子加速到接近光速。为了做这种研究，Chadwick离开了剑桥，去了Liverpool大学，因为那里给了他基金建造一个回旋加速器。在那里，他发现用告诉中子轰击原子，比如铀，可以产生极大的能量。如果可以利用这种能量，就可以产生链式反应，得到裂变，也就是原子分裂的结果。结束了二战的原子弹就是这个工作的结果，Chadwick是英国这方面工程的领导专家。

Many thought that Chadwick's discovery of the neutron solved the problems of the structures of atoms (the building-blocks of the universe). But they were wrong. There were many surprises still to be discovered. Yet even the basic understanding of the electron, proton and neutron had involved physicists with several waves and particles, such as the alpha, beta and gamma rays. They had had to understand other mysterious phenomena, such as X-rays, and the discovery that nature trades in those small packets, called quanta. Nuclear physics and quantum physics: these were the areas of physics at the cutting edge of knowledge for much of the twentieth century.

许多人觉得Chadwick关于中子的发现解决了分子结构的问题（宇宙的基础构件），但他们错了，仍然还有很多惊喜等待发现。即使是关于电子、质子和中子的基本理解，也有几位物理学家分别认为是波或者粒子，比如α射线，β射线或γ射线。这进一步使人理解了其他的神秘现象，比如X射线，以及自然界以小包为单位进行交换，称为quanta量子。核物理和量子力学，这是二十世纪里物理学最尖端的知识。

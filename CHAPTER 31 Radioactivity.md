# CHAPTER 31 Radioactivity
# 第31章 放射性

Have you ever broken a bone, or swallowed something by mistake? If so, the chances are you had an X-ray so a doctor could see inside your body without having to open it up. X-rays are routine today. At the end of the nineteenth century, they were a sensation. X-rays were the first kind of radiation to be harnessed, even before the meaning of radiation was properly understood. Radioactivity and atomic bombs came later.

你有没有骨折过，或误吞了什么东西？如果有过，那么你很可能照射过X射线，这样医生不用对你解剖，就可以看到你体内的情况。X射线检查现在只是例行检查而已。19世纪最后，这可是非常轰动的事情。X射线是得到运用的第一种放射物，甚至在使用后好久放射性的概念还没有理解。放射能力和原子弹随后得到了发现。

In Germany, X-rays are still sometimes called 'Rontgen rays', after Wilhelm Rontgen (1845-1923). He was not the first to have seen their power, but he was the first to realize what he had seen. Science is often like that: it is not enough simply to see - you must understand what you are looking at.

在德国，现在X射线有时候还被称为伦琴射线，这是以Wilhelm Rontgen（1845-1923）的名字命名的。他不是第一次发现这种现象的，但他是第一个意识到他看到了什么的。科学经常是这样的：不是那么容易看到，你必须理解你正在观察的东西。

In the 1890s, Rontgen, along with many other physicists (remember J.J.Thomson?) was working with the cathode ray tube. On 8 November 1895, he noticed that a photographic plate, some distance from his cathode ray tube, had mysteriously been exposed. It was covered with black paper, and at that time scientists assumed that cathode rays had no effect that far away. He spent the next six weeks working out what was happening. Other scientists had observed the same thing but had not done anything about it. Rontgen discovered that these new rays went in a straight line, and were not affected by magnetic fields. Unlike light, they could not be reflected nor bent by a glass lens. But they could penetrate solid material, including his wife's hand! She posed for the first X-ray picture, her wedding ring clearly visible along with the bones of her fingers. Not knowing exactly what these rays were, he simply called them 'X-rays'. After the six weeks of hard work, he told the world.

在1890年，伦琴和许多其他物理学家（记得J.J. Thomson么）正在阴极射线管旁工作。在1895年11月8日，他注意到在阴极射线管旁边的一个摄影板神秘的曝光了。摄影板盖着黑纸，而且那时候科学家认为阴极射线的作用距离没那么远。他花了后面的6周来研究到底发生了神秘。其他科学家也观察到了同样的事情，但没有对其进行研究。伦琴发现这种射线直线发射，并不被磁场影响。和光不同，他们不会被玻璃镜头反射或折射。它们还可以穿透固体材料，包括他妻子的手！她照射形成了第一张X射线照片，她的结婚戒指清楚的戴在她手指的骨头上，因为不知道这种射线叫神秘，他就将其称为X射线。在努力工作六周后，他告诉了世界。

X- rays became an immediate hit. Their medical uses were instantly recognized, in diagnosing broken bones or locating bullets or other things that shouldn't be lodged inside a body. Few things have ever been so instantly taken up by the general public. 'X-ray resistant' underwear was quickly for sale. Physicists debated what exactly X-rays were. After more than a decade of further research, X-rays were shown to be radiation with an unusually short wavelength and high energy. Early on, laboratory workers noticed that X- rays could damage human flesh, causing burns to appear, so they were used to try to kill cancer cells as early as 1896. It took a while longer for people to realize just how dangerous they were, and several of the early researchers died of radiation poisoning, or of a blood cancer called leukaemia. X-rays could cause as well as fight cancer.

X射线迅速变的成功。其医学应用立刻得到了认可，用于判定骨折或定位子弹或其他不应在体内的东西。很少有东西能这么立刻就得到公众认可。防X射线内衣很快就开售了。物理学家争论到底X射线是什么。经过十几年的继续研究后，发现X射线是一种波长很短能量很高的辐射。早先实验室工人发现X射线可以破坏人体组织，导致烧伤，所以在1896年的时候被用于杀死癌细胞。花了挺长时间人们才发现X射线非常危险，几个早期研究人员由于辐射中毒而死，或者因为一种叫白血病的血癌而死。X射线可以杀死癌细胞，同样也会导致癌症。

While Rontgen worked with X-rays, another form of radiation- radioactivity - was discovered, this time in France. Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) was studying fluorescence, the way in which some substances glow, or naturally give off light. He was using a compound of uranium that did just that. When he discovered that this compound affected a photographic plate, just as Rontgen's X-rays had done, he assumed that he had discovered another source of this mysterious ray. But Becquerel found in 1896 that his rays did not behave like Rontgen's. They were a different kind of radiation, without the obvious dramatic effects of the X-rays that could 'see' through clothes or skin, but still worth another look.

当伦琴研究X射线的时候，发现了另一种辐射，也就是放射，这次是在法国发现的。Henri Becquerel（1852-1908）在研究荧光，也就是一些物质放光的方法，或自然发光。他使用的是一种铀的化合物来进行研究。当他发现这种化合物影响了摄影板，就像伦琴的X射线那样的时候，他觉得他发现了另一种神秘的射线。但Becquerel在1896年发现他的射线和伦琴射线并不一样，这是另一种不同的辐射，并不能像X射线一样穿透衣服或皮肤，但仍然值得进一步研究。

In Paris, this challenge was taken up by the famous husband and wife physicists, Pierre and Marie Curie (1859-1906; 1867-1934). In 1898, the Curies obtained a ton of pitchblende, crude tar-like stuff that contains some uranium. As they were extracting their relatively pure uranium, radioactivity burned their hands. They also discovered two new radioactive elements, which they named thorium and polonium, the latter after Marie's native Poland. As these elements had properties similar to uranium's, scientists around the world pressed to find out more about their powerful rays. These were the beta rays (streams of electrons); the alpha rays (shown in 1899 by Rutherford to be helium atoms with no electrons, and so positively charged); and gamma rays (without charge, but later shown to be electromagnetic radiation similar to X-rays). The Curies were truly heroic in their dedication to science. After Pierre was killed in a street accident, Marie continued their work, despite having their two young children to look after.

在巴黎，著名的夫妇物理学家Pierre Curie和Marie Curie（1859-1906; 1867-1934）继续进行这项研究。1898年，居里夫妇得到了一吨沥青铀矿，那是一种粗糙的像焦油一样的含铀物质。当他们在提取相对较纯的铀时，放射烧伤了他们的手。他们还发现了两种新的放射性元素，他们称之为钍和钋，后者是以居里夫人的祖国波兰命名的。由于这些元素的性质和铀类似，世界上的科学家都希望发现更多强力的射线。它们是β射线（电子束），α射线（1899年Rutherford发现是没有电子的氦原子，所以带正电荷），γ射线（不带电荷，但后来发现是和X射线类似的电磁辐射）。居里夫人在为科学献身方面可以称为英雄，Pierre在一场街头意外被杀后，Marie继续他们的工作（虽然还有两个幼小的孩子要照顾）。

The ancient promise of alchemy, to see one element change into another, was almost fulfilled by the discovery of radioactivity. Almost, because the alchemists' dream had been to change lead or some other base metal into gold; what radioactivity did was transmute uranium into lead, a valuable metal into a base one! Still, Nature could do what the alchemists had merely dreamed of.

让一种元素变为另一种元素的点金术古老诺言，几乎就要被放射性现象的发现实现了。说是几乎，是因为炼金术师的梦想是把铅或其他基本金属变为金子，而放射是把铀这种贵金属变成铅这种基本金属！但自然还是能够做到炼金术师只能梦想的东西。

Like X-rays, radioactivity had important medical uses. Radium, another radioactive element discovered by Marie Curie, was especially valued. Its rays could kill cancer cells. But, like X-rays, radioactivity also causes cancer if the dose is too high. Many early workers, including Marie Curie, died from the effects of radiation, before proper safety guidelines were worked out. Her daughter, Irene, won her own Nobel Prize for work in the same field, and died early of the blood cancer that had killed her mother.

放射现象和X射线一样有重要的医学用处。居里夫人发现的另一种放射性元素，镭，特别有用。它的射线可以杀死癌细胞。但和X射线一样，如果放射的剂量过高，也会导致癌症。许多早期工作者像居里夫人，都由于放射死去了，因为妥善的防护措施还没有制定出来。她的女儿，Irene，由于同样领域的工作获得了诺贝尔奖，但也和她妈妈一样由于血癌去世了。

Uranium, thorium, polonium and radium are naturally radioactive. What does this mean? These radioactive elements are what physicists call 'heavy'. Their nucleus is very tightly packed and this makes it unstable. It is this instability that we detect as the radioactive rays. It was called 'radioactive decay' because when particles were lost, the element did literally decay, becoming a different element and taking up a different place in the periodic table. Studying this decay carefully continued that vital work of filling in the knowledge-gaps in the periodic table.

铀，钍，钋和镭这都是自然界存在的放射元素。这是什么意思呢？这些放射性元素是物理学家所说的“重元素”。它们的原子核排列紧密，这使得其不稳定。就是这种不稳定性使其产生放射性。这被称为放射性衰变，因为当失去了一些粒子后，这些元素的确衰变称为了另一种不同的元素，在元素周期表上的位置也改变了。小心的研究这种衰变现象，填补了元素周期表的知识空白。

It also provided a valuable way of dating events in the earth's history, a process called ‘radiometric dating’. Ernest Rutherford was a pioneer in this development, too, suggesting in 1905 that the technique would help in dating the age of the earth. Physicists calculated how long it would take for half of the atoms in a naturally radioactive element (uranium, for example) to decay away to its end product, the different version of the element (lead, in this example). This period of time was called the element's half-life. Elements' half-lives can vary from a few seconds to millions of years. Once they knew an element's half-life, scientists could date an event by looking in a fossil or a rock (any naturally occurring sample) to see how much there was of the original element and how much of the decayed one. The ratio between the two elements would tell them the age of the sample. One unusual form of carbon is naturally radioactive and its half-life can be used to date the fossilized remains of once-living animals and plants. All living things take up carbon through their lifetime. When they die this stops. So measuring the amount of radioactive carbon in fossils provides a date for their formation. Radiometric dating uses the same principle to date rocks, which gives a much longer time frame. The technique has transformed the study of fossils, because they are no longer just older or younger than each other - we know their approximate age.

这也为确定地球历史事件的发生日期提供了一种重要方式，称之为放射性测定年代。Ernest Rutherford也是这个发现的先驱者，1905年，他提出这种方式可以帮助确定地球的年龄。物理学家计算了自然放射性元素（如铀）一半的原子衰变成为不同的金属（如铅），所需的时间，这个时间被称为元素的半衰期。元素的半衰期可以从几秒到几百万年。一旦知道了元素的半衰期，科学家可以从化石、岩石（或自然产生的样本）中研究还有多少原始的放射性元素，有多少衰变后的元素，就可以知道事件发生的时间。通过两种元素的比率，就可以知道样本的年龄。碳元素的一种异常形态是有自然放射性的，其半衰期可以用来确定曾经存活的动植物的化石残留的日期。所有生物生存的时候都吸收很多碳元素，当死了以后，摄取的过程就停止了。所以测定放射性碳元素含量可以确定化石的形成时间。放射性测定年代法使用相同的方法来确定岩石的时间，岩石的时间要长得多。这种技术改变了化石研究，因为化石们不再只是互相之间比较老一些或年轻一些，我们可以知道它们大致的时间。

Physicists quickly saw that enormous amounts of energy were involved in radioactive emissions. Naturally radioactive elements like uranium, and the radioactive forms of common elements like carbon, are scarce. But when you bombard atoms with alpha particles or neutrons, you can get many elements to artificially emit radioactivity's energy. This showed how much energy is packed into the atom's nucleus. Finding out how to make use of this potential has driven many physicists for the past hundred years.

物理学家迅速发现放射现象中牵扯到很多能量。自然放射元素，像铀，和普通元素如碳的放射形态，都是非常稀有的。但是，如果用α粒子或中字轰击原子，可以发现很多元素都会发射出放射性能量。这说明原子核中含有很多能量，寻找如何利用这些能量的方法在过去百年都是物理学家研究的动力。

When you bombard an atom and make it throw out an alpha particle from its nucleus, you 'split' the atom and make it a different element. This is nuclear fission. The nucleus has lost two protons. The alternative, nuclear fusion, occurs when an atom absorbs a particle and takes up a new place on the periodic table. Both fission and fusion release energy. The possibility of nuclear fusion was shown in the late 1930s by German and Austrian physicists, including Lise Meitner (1878-1968). Born a Jew, Meitner had converted to Christianity, but she still had to flee Nazi Germany in 1938. She discussed the fusion of two hydrogen atoms to form an atom of helium, the next element on the periodic table. From studying the sun and other stars, the conversion of hydrogen to helium was shown to be the main source of stellar energy. (Helium was discovered in the sun before it was found on earth: its atoms show characteristic wavelengths when examined with an instrument called the spectroscope.) This reaction needs very high temperatures, and in the 1930s it could not be done in the laboratory. But in theory, you could make a hydrogen bomb (a fusion bomb) that would release a vast amount of energy when it exploded.

当你轰击一个原子，使之从原子中放射出一个α粒子，你就撕裂了这个原子，使之成为另一种不同的元素。这就是一次核裂变，原子核丢去了2个中子。而核聚变，则是原子核吸收了一个粒子，然后在元素周期表上改变了一下位置。聚变和裂变都会释放能量。核聚变在20世纪30年代由包括犹太人Lise Meitner（1878-1968）的一些奥地利物理学家验证。Meitner成为了基督徒，但仍然在1938年不得不逃离纳粹德国。她研究了两个氢原子聚变成为氦原子的情况。通过研究太阳和其他恒星，发现恒星能量的主要来源就是氢原子聚变为氦原子（氦首先在太阳中发现，然后才在地球发现，当用分光镜观测时可以发现氦原子有特殊的波长）。这种反应需要极高的温度，在30年代，在实验室还打不到这样的温度。但在理论上，是可以制造出释放巨大能量的氢弹的。

In the 1930s, the alternative - the atomic or fission bomb – was more do-able. As the Nazis continued their aggression in Europe, war seemed increasingly likely. Scientists in several countries, including Germany, worked secretly towards preparing such devastating weapons. Crucial in this horrifying dance towards total war was the work of the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901-54). Fermi and his group showed that bombarding atoms with 'slow' neutrons would cause the desired nuclear fission. Slow neutrons were passed through paraffin (or a similar substance) on the way to their target atom. At this reduced speed they were more likely to lodge in the nucleus, causing it to split. Fermi left Italy in 1938 to escape its Fascist regime, which was sympathetic to the Nazis. He went to the United States, as did so many of the most creative scientists (and writers, artists and thinkers) in the period. Today we sometimes speak of the 'brain drain', meaning that the best 'brains' leave their homes for better working conditions in other countries: more money, a bigger lab, a better chance to live their lives as they wish. People in the late 1930s and early 1940s fled because they had been sacked from their jobs and feared for their lives. The Nazis and Fascists did many horrific things. They also changed the face of science, and Britain and the United States gained most from this enforced brain drain.

在30年代，原子弹或裂变弹是更可行的。随着纳粹在欧洲的攻击性越来强，战争变得越来越可能。几个国家的科学家，包括德国，秘密工作研发这种毁灭性的武器。在走向战争的恐怖之舞的关键工作是意大利物理学家Enrico Fermi（1901-1954）。Fermi和他的团队研究得出，用慢中子轰击原子会比较容易得到裂变的效果。慢中子通过石蜡（或类似的物质）往目标原子行进。在减速后更容易进入原子核中，使其分裂。Fermi1938年逃离了法西斯的意大利（与纳粹德国是友好关系），他去了美国，那个时期很多其他最有创造力的科学家（作家、艺术家和思想家）都去了美国。今天我们经常说到“人才流失”，意思就是最好的人才都离开了家乡去了有更好工作环境的其他国家：更多的钱，更大的实验室，可以得到更好的生活。30年代末期40年代初期的人们逃离是因为他们被剥夺了工作，为生活担心。纳粹和法西斯做了很多恐怖的事情，他们也改变了科学的面貌，英国和美国在这次人才流失中获益最多。

In the USA, many of the refugees would join the top-secret ‘Manhattan Project’. This was one of the most expensive scientific projects ever undertaken, but these were increasingly desperate times. By the late 1930s, the dramatic improvements in understanding the radioactive elements convinced many physicists that they could create a nuclear explosion. The difficulty was in controlling it. Some thought it would be too dangerous: the resulting chain reaction would simply blow up the whole planet. When war was declared in 1939, physicists in Britain and the USA believed that scientists in Germany and Japan would continue to work towards an atomic bomb and that the Allies must do the same. A number of scientists wrote to the American President, Franklin Roosevelt, urging him to authorize an Allied response. Among them was Albert Einstein, the world's most famous scientist and also a refugee from Nazi Germany.

在美国，很多难民参加了最高机密的曼哈顿工程。这是最昂贵的科学工程之一，但那时在越来越绝望的日子里。30年代后期，理解放射性元素的奇迹进展使很多物理学家相信他们可以制造一个核爆炸，难点在于如何控制爆炸。一些人觉得这太过危险，链式反应的结果很可能炸掉整个地球。当战争在1939年打响时，英国和美国的物理学家相信，德国和日本也在进行原子弹的研究，所以盟国必须也这样做。一些科学家写信给美国总统罗斯福，促使他授权盟国回应。这些人中有爱因斯坦，世界上最著名的科学家，也是纳粹德国的难民之一。

Roosevelt agreed. At sites in Tennessee, Chicago and New Mexico, the many components of the fateful step were coordinated. The Manhattan Project was run along military lines. Scientists stopped publishing their findings. They put aside science's core value of openness and sharing information. War changes human values. The secret was not even shared with Communist Russia, a key ally of the USA and Britain, but still not trusted on the subject of top-secret bombs. By 1945, German, Japanese and Russian efforts to build atomic bombs had still not got very far, even though one of the scientists in the US secretly fed the Russians with information. But the Manhattan Project had produced two bombs. One used uranium, the other plutonium, a man-made radioactive element. A smaller test bomb was exploded in the American desert. It worked. The bombs were ready for use.

罗斯福同意了。在Tennessee，Chicago和New Mexico，协调进行了决定性步骤中的很多部件。曼哈顿计划通过军方进行，科学家不再发表他们的发现结果。他们放弃了科学的核心价值，开放和分享信息。战争改变人们的价值观。这个秘密甚至没有和共产主义的苏联分享，虽然是美国和英国的关键盟友，但在最高机密的炸弹前仍然没有得到信任。到1945年，德国，日本和苏联制造原子弹的努力仍然没有很多进展，即使美国有科学家秘密为苏联提供信息。曼哈顿计划制造了两个炸弹，一个用铀，另一个用人造放射性元素钚。在美国的沙漠中成功爆炸了一个较小的实验炸弹，所以这些炸弹就可以使用了。

Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, so no bomb was dropped in Europe. Japan continued its aggression in the Pacific. The new US President, Harry Truman, ordered the uranium bomb to be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August. It was detonated by firing one piece of uranium into another. The Japanese still did not surrender. Truman ordered the plutonium bomb to be dropped on a second Japanese city, Nagasaki, three days later. That action finally ended the war. The bombs had killed about 300,000 people, mostly civilians, and Japan surrendered. Everyone now saw the astounding power of nuclear energy. Our world was changed forever. Many of the scientists who had made these weapons of mass destruction knew their achievements had ended a terrible war, but worried about what they had created.

德国在1948年8月投降了，所以在欧洲没有丢下原子弹。日本在太平洋继续进攻行动。新的美国总统Harry Truman命令在8月6日在Hiroshima投下铀弹，通过将一块铀发射到另一块中引爆炸弹。日本人仍然没投降，Truman命令3天后在Nagasaki丢下另一枚钚弹。这次行动结束了战争。两个炸弹杀死了大约30万人，主要是平民，所以日本投降了。每个人都看到了原子弹的惊人能量。我们的世界永远的被改变了。很多造出这种大规模杀伤武器的科学家知道他们的成果结束了这场可怕的战争，但担心他们制造出的武器。

The incredible power of atomic energy continues to be important in our world. So, also, do its dangers. Mistrust between Russia and the USA continued after the Second World War, developing into the ‘Cold War’. Both countries built up vast stores of atomic or nuclear weapons. Fortunately, they have not yet been used in anger, and although the stockpiles have been reduced over the years, through agreement, the number of nations that have nuclear weapons has grown.

原子能的惊人能力在我们的世界中仍然非常重要，非常危险。美国和苏联战后的互不信任发展成了冷战，两个国家都制造并储存了大量核武器。幸运的是，他们还没被用过，虽然库存的核武器已经通过协议减少了很多，但有核国家的数量增加了。

The physics that was learned during the Manhattan Project has also been used to produce a more controlled release of energy. Nuclear power can generate electricity with only a fraction of the greenhouse gases released by burning coal and other fossil fuels. France generates almost three-quarters of its electricity by nuclear power, for instance. But the dangers of accidents and risks from terrorism have made many fearful of nuclear power, despite its benefits. Few things in modern science and technology better illustrate the mix of politics and social values than does the question: What should we do with our knowledge of nuclear energy?

曼哈顿工程中得到的物理知识还被用于生产更加可控的能量。核能可以被用于发电，而且产生的温室气体只是燃烧煤和其他化石燃料的很少一部分。例如法国3/4的电力都是核能，尽管有诸多好处，但意外的危险和恐怖主义的风险使很多人对核能有所恐惧。现代科学和技术中没有什么能描述政治和社会价值的东西，所以问题出现了：我们怎样运用已经掌握的核能的知识呢？

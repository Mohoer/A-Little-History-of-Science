# CHAPTER 26 Little Boxes of Life
# 第26章 生命的小盒子

There are things we simply cannot see or hear. Many stars are beyond our gaze, and we can't see atoms, or even the tiny creatures that teem in puddles of rainwater. We can't hear sounds that many birds or mice can. But we can still learn about them, asking questions and using instruments that let us see or hear far better than with our eyes and ears alone. Just as telescopes let us see further into space, microscopes help us see further into the tiny building blocks of living creatures.

总是有我们看不到或听不到的东西。很多星星都在我们的凝视距离之外，我们也看不到原子，甚至是雨水坑里大量存在的生物。我们无法听到很多鸟类或老鼠可以听到的声音。但我们还是可以了解它们，通过问问题，使用适当的仪器，帮助我们看到或听到那些我们只用自己的眼睛和耳朵无法达到的目标。就像我们用望远镜可以看的更远，深入太空，显微镜可以帮助我们看到生物的基本组件。

In the seventeenth century, the pioneer of microbiology, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, had used his small microscopes to look at blood cells and the hairs on a fly's legs. A century later, more advanced microscopes were allowing naturalists to examine these finer details of anatomy, and the wonderful array of tiny life. A 'compound' microscope could make things appear even bigger than a simple microscope. It is a tube with two lenses, the second of which magnifies the first image, so you get their combined magnification. Many thoughtful people did not completely trust microscopes. Early compound microscopes produced distortions or illusions of various kinds - for example, strange colors or lines where none existed. At the same time, there were only crude methods of cutting things into thin slices to examine them, and of trying to fix these slices on to a slide (a thin glass sheet). Consequently, many scientists thought using microscopes was not worth the effort.

在17世纪时，微生物学的先驱，Antonie van Leeuwenhoek，用他微小的显微镜观察过血细胞和苍蝇腿上的毛发。一个世纪后，更先进的显微镜使博物学家可以查看解剖学更精细的细节，以及精彩的大批微小生命。一个“复合”显微镜会比简单的显微镜更能放大物体。这是一个有2个透镜的管子，第二个透镜放大第一个的成像，所以可以得到组合的放大倍数。很多深思的人不完全信任显微镜。早期的复合显微镜会产生失真以及各种假象，比如，不存在的奇怪颜色或线条。同时，将物品切割成待观察的薄片的技术是粗糙的，薄片固定到载片（一个薄薄的玻璃片）的技术也是粗糙的。结果，很多科学家认为用显微镜不太值得。

Yet doctors and biologists wanted to understand how bodies work in the finest possible detail. In France, Xavier Bichat (1771-1802) began to investigate the different substances -what we call the 'tissues', whether hard like bone, soft like fat, or liquid like blood - that make up the human body. Bichat realized that the same kinds of tissues behaved in similar ways, no matter where they were in the human body. Thus, all muscles were composed of the same sort of tissue whether they were busy contracting in legs, arms, hands or feet. All tendons (the bits connecting muscle to bone), or the thin coating called serous tissue (like that surrounding the heart), were similar in all parts of the body. The study of cells and tissues is called 'histology' and Bichat was 'the father of histology'. Yet Bichat was one of those who were suspicious of microscopes, and he used only a simple magnifying glass.

但医生和生物学家想了解人体在可能的最细节处是如何工作的。在法国，Xavier Bichat (1771-1802)开始研究组成我们身体的各种物质，现在我们称之为“组织”，不论是硬如骨头，软如脂肪，或是像血液那样的液体。Bichat发现同样种类的组织行为方式也类似，与在身体哪个部位没关系。所以，所有的肌肉都是由相同种类的组织构成的，不论是胳膊上的，腿上的，手上还是脚上的肌肉。所有的肌腱（连接肌肉与骨头的部分），或者是称为浆液组织那薄薄的涂层（比如心脏周围的那些），在全身各处都是类似的。细胞与组织的研究称为“组织学”，Bichat是“组织学之父”。但Bichat是怀疑显微镜的人之一，他只用一个简单的放大透镜。

Bichat's work inspired others to try to understand plants and animals in terms of their smaller, and more basic, building-blocks. In the early decades of the 1800s, there were several competing ideas about just what these fundamental building-blocks of plants and animals were. The technical problems of compound microscopes began to be solved in France and Britain from the late 1820s. From then on people looking down their instruments could be more confident that what they were seeing was an accurate picture of what was really there.

Bichat的工作激励他人以更小更基础的基本成分来理解动植物。在19世纪早期几十年时，这些动植物的基本组件到底是什么，有几种竞争性的见解。19世纪20年代时，复合显微镜的技术问题在法国和英国得到了解决，从那时候开始人们更加自信的透过设备观察，相信他们正在看的是真实存在的东西的精确影像。

In the 1830s, the new microscopes helped two German scientists argue that the crucial building-blocks of life were cells, and that all plants and animals are composed of cells. One of these scientists was a botanist named Schleiden. The other was a doctor, Theodor Schwann (1810-82). Schwann explored how cells worked and how they were created. In the cells of plants and animals, activities take place that allow such things as movement, digestion, breathing and sensing. The cells act together, and they are the key to understanding how plants and animals function and live.

在19世纪30年代，新的显微镜使两名德国科学家认为生命的关键基本组件就是细胞，所有的动植物都是由细胞构成的。其中一个科学家是植物学家Schleiden，另一个是医生Theodor Schwann(1810-82)，Schwann探寻了细胞是怎样工作的，以及细胞是如何创造的。在动植物的细胞中发生的活动使运动、消化、呼吸和感知成为可能。细胞共同行动，它们是理解动植物如何生存活动的关键。

When you injure yourself- say, you cut your finger - more skin tissue will grow to heal the wound. But if tissues are made of cells, how are the new cells made? Schwann was very interested in chemistry, and he proposed that new cells crystallize out of a special kind of fluid, just as crystals can be grown in a laboratory from certain solutions. He wanted to explain how embryos develop in an egg, or the womb. He also wondered where the cells come from, those which appear if you get a scratch or a bruise. As a doctor, he could see that the area around an injury gets red and it may get full of pus cells. These pus cells, he thought, crystallize out of the watery fluid that we see as the swelling. It was an attractive theory, combining chemistry and biology, but it was quickly shown to be too simple.

当你伤害了自己，比如，切到了自己的手，会长出更多的皮肤组织以治愈伤口。但如果组织是由细胞构成的，那么新的细胞是如何造出来的呢？Schwann对化学非常感兴趣，他提出新的细胞是由一种特殊液体中结晶出来的，就像实验室中的特定溶液可以长出晶体一样。他希望解释胚胎是如何在蛋或子宫中成长的。他还想知道细胞是从哪里来的，就像那些受到刮伤或擦伤然后长出来的。作为医生，他能看到伤口周围区域会变红，会充满脓细胞。他认为，这些脓细胞是由我们看到的肿胀里的液体结晶出来的。这是个很吸引人的理论，结合了化学和生物学，但很快就证实了这个理论太过简单了。

As microscopes improved, more and more scientists began to watch what happens in cells. One of the most important cell-watchers was Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902). A man of wide interests, Virchow, mostly a pathologist, was also active in public health, politics, anthropology and archaeology. (He helped excavate the city of Troy, written about by Homer around 800 BC.) In the 1850s, Virchow began to think what the cell theory meant for medicine, and for the study of disease, known as pathology. Like Schwann, he saw cells as the basic units of living bodies. Understanding their functions in health and disease would be key to a new kind of medicine, based on science. He presented his ideas in a very important book called Cellular Pathology (1858). He showed that the diseases doctors see in their sick patients, and can later examine in the autopsy room (when studying their dead bodies), were always the result of events in the cells. These included the growth of cancer (which he was especially interested in), inflammation, with its pus and swelling, and heart disease. ‘Learn to see microscopically’, he always taught his students in their pathology classes: peer down to the level of the cells.

随着显微镜的改进，越来越多的科学家开始观察细胞中发生了什么。最重要的细胞观察者之一是Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902)，他是个有着广泛兴趣的人，主要是一个病理学家，在公共健康、政治、人类学和考古学中也都非常活跃（他帮助挖掘了公元前800年Homer记录下的Troy城）。在19世纪50年代，Virchow开始思考细胞理论对于药学意味着什么，以及对病理学意味着什么。与Schwann一样，他视细胞为活体的基本单位。理解它们在健康与疾病中的作用是基于科学的新药的关键。他将自己的观点在一部重要著作《细胞病理学》（1858）中进行了阐述。他展示了医生在病人那看到的病，以及在解剖室检查到的东西（当研究他们的尸体时），都是细胞中事件的结果。这包括癌细胞的成长（他对于这一点非常感兴趣），伴随着脓肿的炎症，以及心脏病。“学会通过显微镜观察”，他永远在病理学课堂这样教导学生：凝视到细胞那样的下层。

Virchow combined his brilliant microscopic observations with a profound statement of a biological truth: ‘All cells come from cells’. This is where he overtook Schwann. What he meant was that the pus cells in an angry swelling - after a splinter or a scrape, for example - actually came from other cells. They were not crystallized from body fluids. It also meant that cancer growths resulted from other cells, in this case cells that were behaving incorrectly and dividing when they should not. Every cell we can observe under the microscope has been produced by an existing cell (known as the 'mother' cell) dividing into two (the 'daughter' cells). Indeed, as biologists watched more and more, they sometimes saw this cell division taking place. And they noticed that the interior of the cells seemed to change when the cell divided into two. Something special was happening.

Virchow将他杰出的显微镜观察结果与生物学中意义深远的一句事实结合了起来：“所有细胞都来自细胞”，这是他赶上Schwann的地方。他的意思是发炎肿胀（比如由刮伤或擦伤导致的）中的脓细胞实际上是由其他细胞中来的，而并不是由体液中结晶出来的。这也意味着癌症的发展也是由其他细胞导致的，在这种情况下细胞的行为模式是错误的，在不该分裂的时候仍然在分裂。我们在显微镜下看到的每个细胞都是由一个细胞（母细胞）分裂成两个（子细胞）。确实，当生物学家观察的越来越多，它们有时候会观察到正在发生的细胞分裂。他们注意到当细胞分裂成两个的时候，其内部会发生变化，有一些特殊的事情正在发生。

Earlier observations had already shown that the cell is not just a sack, full of the same kind of stuff. In the 1830s, an English botanist, Robert Brown (1773-1858), had argued that every cell has something at its center: a nucleus, which is darker than the surrounding substance. Brown had looked at a lot of cells under his microscope and they all seemed to have this nucleus. The nucleus soon became accepted as a part of all cells. All the other material enclosed within the cell walls became known as protoplasm. This word means literally 'first mould', because at the time the protoplasm was viewed as the living stuff within the cells, whose functions gave life to plants and animals. In time other structures besides the nucleus were seen and named in cells.

早期的观察已经证明，细胞并不是只是一个袋子，里面装满了同种类的东西。在19世纪30年代，一位英国植物学家，Robert Brown (1773-1858)，辩论到每个细胞都有什么东西作为其中心：一个细胞核，与周围的物质比起来更暗一些。Brown通过显微镜观察过很多细胞，似乎它们都有细胞核。很快，大家都接受了细胞核是细胞的一部分。其他细胞壁内部的物质被称为细胞质，英文单词的意思就是“第一模板”，因为那时候细胞质被视作细胞内部的生命体，其作用就是赋予动植物生命。后来细胞内除了细胞核的其他结构也被观测到并进行了命名。

Scientists quickly accepted the discovery of the nucleus and other parts of cells. But it was quite a different story for the very old debate about ‘spontaneous generation’, the observation that rotting meat and stagnant water seemed to spawn all kinds of tiny, but living, creatures. People knew that if they left a piece of uncovered meat on a table, in a couple of days they could expect to see maggots. They didn't know that flies lay eggs that hatch into maggots, so how could they explain where the maggots came from? Examine a drop of pond water under a microscope, and you will see that it is swarming with tiny creatures. How did they get there?

科学家迅速接受了细胞核和细胞其他部分的发现。但“自然生殖”的古老辩论则是另外一个完全不同的故事，这说的是腐烂的肉和死水似乎可以生产大量各种微小的生物。人们知道如果将一块未遮盖的肉放在桌子上，几天后就可以看到蛆虫。他们不知道苍蝇会在上面下卵，然后孵化成蛆虫，所以怎么解释蛆虫是哪里来的呢？在显微镜下检查一滴池塘里的水，就会看到充满了微小的生物，它们是怎么来的呢？

To nineteenth-century scientists, the easiest explanation was that these creatures had been made by, or generated from, their nourishing environments by a kind of chemical process. This was the common view, and it seemed to make sense. Since the maggots were not there when the meat was put down, how better to explain their presence than to assume that as the flesh decomposed it actually produced these rather disgusting creatures? Few people thought that complex things - elephants or oak trees - were spontaneously generated, but simple forms of life seemed to pop up without obvious explanation, except that they were somehow generated from their surroundings. Even Schwann's notion of living cells crystallizing from the special bodily fluid was a kind of spontaneous generation, living cells coming from non-living material.

对于19世纪的科学家来说，最简单的解释就是这些生物是由一种化学过程在滋润的环境中产生的，这是共同的观点，似乎讲得通。因为当肉放下的时候，蛆虫是不在那里的，除了认为当肉腐烂时，实际上就产生了这些非常恶心的生物，还能有什么更好的解释呢？很少有人想到复杂的物体，比如大象或橡树，是自然繁殖的，但简单形式的生命似乎是突然冒出来的，没有明显的解释，除了它们是由环境中莫名其妙的产生出来了。

Naturalists in the 1600s and 1700s thought that they had shown that spontaneous generation does not occur, but the problem did not go away. It was hotly debated from the late 1850s by two French scientists. The winner finally convinced the scientific community that there was no spontaneous generation. But the story is not a simple one: the winner (who was correct) did not exactly play fair.

17世纪和18世纪的博物学家认为他们已经证实了自然生殖是不存在的，但问题并没有解决。在19世纪50年代后期，两个法国科学家进行了激烈的辩论。胜出者说服了科学界，并没有自然生殖。但其故事并不简单：胜出者（是正确的一方）并没有公平竞争。

The first of these two French scientists was a chemist, Louis Pasteur (1822-95). In the 1850s he had begun to suspect that living cells could do quite extraordinary things. He was used to investigating the chemical properties of various compounds. He was also familiar with fermentation, the process in which grapes are mixed with yeast to make wine, and flour is mixed with yeast to make bread rise before baking it. Before Pasteur, fermentation was thought to be a particular kind of chemical reaction in which the yeast just acted as a catalyst - something to speed things up but remaining unchanged by the reaction. Pasteur would show instead that fermentation was a biological process caused by the yeast as it lived, feeding on the sugars in grapes and flour. The cells in the yeast were dividing to produce more cells, and in the process their living activities caused the desired alcohol in the wine or made the bread light and soft. Of course, these processes had to be stopped at the right time, by heating. If the yeast was allowed to go on and on living, the wine would turn to vinegar and the bread dough would eventually sink again. If this was happening in fermentation, Pasteur wondered about how other living micro-organisms might be involved in processes attributed to chemical reactions - such as spontaneous generation. So he turned it into a public competition with his fellow countryman, Felix Pouchet (1800-72), a supporter of spontaneous generation.

两位法国科学家的第一位是一个化学家，Louis Pasteur (1822-95)。在19世纪50年代他开始怀疑活的细胞可以做出相当惊人的事情来。他习惯于调查各种化合物的化学性质，他还对发酵非常熟悉，就是葡萄与酵母混合在一起制作葡萄酒的过程，面粉与酵母一起使烘焙之前的面包发酵的过程。在Pasteur之前，人们认为发酵是一种特殊的化学反应，酵母在其中只是起到催化剂的作用，也就是说只起到加速反应的过程，但本身在反应中保持不变。Pasteur将会展示给大家的是，发酵是个生物过程，酵母以葡萄和面粉中的糖分为食生活的过程。酵母中的细胞正在分裂，产生更多细胞，在这个过程中，它们生存的活动形成了想要的葡萄酒中的酒精，或使面包又轻又软。当然，这个过程必须在适当的时间通过加热来停止。如果酵母持续生存下去，酒就会变成醋，面包生面团会最终再次下陷。如果在发酵的过程中是发生了这些，Pasteur就怀疑那些被认为是化学反应的过程中的微生物发生了什么，比如自然繁殖的过程。他的同乡，Felix Pouchet (1800-72)是支持自然繁殖的说法的，所以他将这个变成了与他同乡的公共竞赛。

In a series of experiments, Pasteur boiled mixtures of straw and water to make them sterile. He then left them exposed to the air and the dust particles floating in it. Usually, if you examined the liquid after a few days, it would be teeming with micro-organisms. Pasteur showed that if you excluded the dust particles from the air, the solution would stay sterile. To show that these micro-organisms came with the dust particles, and not the air itself, he designed a special flask with a curved neck, like a swan's, that allowed in the air but not the dust. When Pouchet did similar experiments, his flasks contained micro-organisms after a few days. He interpreted his results as proving that spontaneous generation can occur. Pasteur assumed that when his experiments didn't turn out as he anticipated, it was because he hadn't cleaned his flasks well enough - and he presumed that Pouchet was always sloppy. Pasteur won the day, even if he quietly ignored the results of some of his experiments when they didn't give him what he wanted and appeared to support Pouchet! He triumphed partly because he was a dogged, determined scientist, who believed he was right, but also because Virchow's important statement that 'all cells come from cells' was gaining support. People wanted to believe Pasteur because his theories were a big step forward from old-fashioned ideas, and that's very important in science too.

在一系列实验中，Pasteur将稻草与水的混合物煮沸，以使其无菌，然后将其置于空气中，有灰尘微粒就落到了上面。通常，如果几天后检查这个液体，将会充满了微生物。Pasteur展示了如果从空气中去除那些灰尘，这个溶液将一直是无菌的。为了证明这些微生物是随着灰尘微粒来的，而并不是从空气中来的，他设计了一个特殊的长颈瓶，有一个像天鹅一样弯曲的脖子，能允许空气进入，但不能使灰尘进入。当Pouchet做了类似的实验时，他的长颈瓶里几天后出现了微生物。他将结果解释为自然繁殖是可以发生的。Pasteur假设当实验结果不是他希望的那样时，这是因为他没有将长颈瓶清理的足够干净，并假定Pouchet一直都很粗心。Pasteur那天赢了，即使他悄悄的忽略了他的一些实验结果并没有给出想要的结果，反而支持Pouchet的观点！他胜利部分是因为他是一个固执又坚定的科学家，相信自己是正确的，也是因为Virchow的名言“所有的细胞都来自细胞”正在获得支持。人们希望相信Pasteur，因为他的理论与老的想法相比是重大进步，这也是科学中非常重要的。

Microscopy allowed great advances in medical and biological research. Microscopes were improved, and so were the tools to prepare specimens to examine under the lenses. Stains – special chemicals that acted like dyes - were especially important, because they could color and highlight features of a cell's structure that would otherwise be overlooked. The stained nucleus, in particular, was observed to have a series of dark-staining strands that were given the name 'chromosomes'. (Chromo comes from the Greek for 'color'.) When a cell was dividing, the chromosomes could actually be seen to swell. The significance of this discovery, and of the other parts of the cell that scientists identified, had to wait until the twentieth century. But nineteenth-century doctors and biologists started the ball rolling. Above all, they showed that if you want to understand how whole plants and animals function, in both health and disease, you needed to start with the cells that they are made of. One kind of cell - single-celled organisms called bacteria - became especially important in understanding diseases. We are not done with Louis Pasteur, for he played a central role in the link between germs and disease, and in understanding how micro-organisms play their part in many aspects of our daily lives.

显微镜的使用使医学和生物学研究得到了巨大进步。显微镜得到了改进，为放在镜片下进行检查而准备标本的工具也得到了改进。生物染色剂，也就是像染料一样的特殊化学物质，尤其重要，因为它们可以给细胞结构的特征上色并突出显示，否则的话可能被忽视掉。特别是被染色的细胞核中被观察到有一系列暗的染色的线条，从而被命名为“染色体”（其希腊语词源就是颜色的意思）。当一个细胞分裂，可以观测到染色体膨胀。科学家这个发现的重要性，以及细胞其他部分发现的重要性，直到20世纪才能被意识到，但19世纪的医生和生物学家已经开始了这项工作。尤其是，他们证明了，如果你想理解整个动植物如何运作，包括健康的和发病的，你需要从组成它们的细胞开始理解。一种细胞在理解疾病时变得尤其重要，这就是一种单细胞生物，称为细菌。Louis Pasteur的故事还没有结束，因为他在发现细菌和疾病之间的关系中起到了核心的作用，在理解微生物在我们日常生活中如何起它们的作用中也起到了重要的作用。

# CHAPTER 16 What Goes Up … Newton
# 第16章 什么东西往上走 - 牛顿

I doubt if you have ever met anyone as smart as Isaac Newton - I haven't. You might have met people as unpleasant as he was. He disliked most people, had temper tantrums, and thought that almost everybody was out to get him. He was secretive, vain and would forget to eat his meals. He had lots of other disagreeable characteristics, but he was clever, and it's the cleverness that we remember today, even if it's quite hard to understand what he thought and wrote.

我很怀疑你有没有遇到像牛顿这样聪明的人，我是没有，你可能遇到过像他这样讨厌的人，他不喜欢大多数人，脾气很大，认为几乎所有人都在对付他。他总是偷偷摸摸的，虚荣，还会忘记吃饭。他还有很多其他不讨人喜欢的特质，但是他聪明，今天我们只记得他聪明，即使要理解他思考和写作的东西是非常困难的。

Isaac Newton (1642-1727) might have been disagreeable no matter what had happened to him, but his childhood was pretty awful. His father died before he was born, and his mother, who didn't expect him to live, left him with her parents after she remarried and had another family. He hated his stepfather, disliked his grandfather and wasn't very fond of either his mother or his grandmother. In fact, from an early age, he started not liking people. He preferred to be alone, as a child and as a very old man. It was obvious, however, that he was very smart, and he was sent to the grammar school in Grantham, near where he lived, in Lincolnshire. He learned good Latin (he could write in English and Latin with equal ease), but spent most of his time at school making models of clocks and other mechanical gadgets and constructing sundials.

牛顿(1642-1727)可能对所有发生在他身上的事都感到讨厌，但他的童年生活是非常糟糕的。他的父亲在他出生前就去世了，他的母亲根本就没指望他能活下来，把他交给了她的父母，然后就再嫁，有了另一个家庭。他痛恨他的继父，厌恶他的祖父，不喜欢他的母亲和祖母。实际上，从年轻的时候，他就开始不喜欢别人。他喜欢独处，从小时候到老了一直这样，但很明显，他非常聪明，被送到Grantham的文法学校，他住在Lincolnshire，学校离他住的地方不远。他拉丁文学的很好（他用拉丁文写作和用英语写作一样容易），但在学校的大部分时间都用于制作钟表模型和其他机械小工具，还有建造日晷。

He also did his own thing when he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1661. He was supposed to read the ancient masters such as Aristotle and Plato. He did read them a little (he was a meticulous note-taker, so we know what he read), but his favorites were the moderns: Descartes, Boyle and other exponents of the new science. Reading was all right, but he wanted to figure things out for himself. To do this he devised many new experiments, but his greatest genius was in mathematics and how it could be used to understand more about the universe.

1661年去了剑桥大学三一学院后，他还是在做自己的事情。他应当去阅读古代大师的著作，像亚里士多德和柏拉图，他确实阅读了一点（他笔记做的很严谨，所以我们知道他读了什么），但他最喜欢的还是现代大师：笛卡尔，Boyle波义耳，以及其他新科学的倡导者。读书很好，但他想自己弄懂一些事情。为了做这些，他设计了很多新实验，但他最大的天才还是在数学上，以及怎样应用在更多的理解宇宙中。

Newton worked out many of his ideas in an incredibly productive couple of years. No scientist except Einstein (Chapter 32) has ever done so much in so short a space of time. Newton's most amazing years were 1665 and 1666. Some of this time he spent at his mother's home in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, because the plague epidemic that was then sweeping England had led the University of Cambridge to close its doors and send the students home. It was during this time that Newton saw ripe apples falling off trees in his mother's garden. It probably wasn't as dramatic as stories have it, but it did remind him of a problem that still needed explaining: why things fall down to earth.

牛顿有几年极其的高产，提出了很多他的新思想。除了爱因斯坦（第32章），没有哪位科学家在如此短的时间内做出如此多的贡献。牛顿最闪亮的年份是1665、1666年，这两年中他有一段时间在Lincolnshire的Woolsthorpe的他妈妈家，因为瘟疫传染病正在横扫英国，剑桥大学不得不关门，将学生送回家里。就是在这段时间里，牛顿在他妈妈的花园里看到成熟的苹果从树上掉落，很可能没有故事里那么有戏剧性，但确实提醒他有个问题仍然需要解释：为什么东西会掉到地上。

He was busy with lots of scientific matters during this period. Take mathematics, for instance. Galileo, Descartes and many other natural philosophers (that is, scientists) had made great strides in developing mathematics as a subject and, even more importantly, in using it to understand the results of their observations and experiments. Newton was an even better mathematician, and he was brilliant in using it in his science. To describe things like movement and gravity mathematically, algebra and geometry are not enough. You must be able to consider very small units of time and movement: an infinitesimal amount, in fact. When examining a bullet fired from a gun, or an apple falling from a tree, or a planet going around the sun, you must focus on the distance it goes in the smallest conceivable moment of time. Many natural philosophers before Newton had seen the problem and thought up various solutions. But Newton, still in his twenties, developed his own mathematical tools to do the job. He called it his method of ‘fluxions’, from the word 'flux' which means something changing. Newton's fluxions did the kind of computations that we still do in the branch of mathematics now called calculus. By October 1666, when he had finished a paper written just for his own satisfaction, he was the foremost mathematician in Europe, but nobody but Newton knew it. He didn't publish his mathematical discoveries straightaway; instead, he used them, and only eventually shared his methods and results with his acquaintances.

这段时间他忙于很多科学事情。以数学为例，伽利略、笛卡尔和其他很多自然哲学家（也就是科学家）在将数学发展成一门学科上取得了很大进展，更重要的是，将其用在了理解他们的观测和实验结果上。牛顿是一个更好的数学家，在将其应用在他的科学上更是杰出。仅用代数和几何来从数学上描述运动和重力是不够的，必须能考虑很小的时间和运动单位，实际上是无穷小的量。当研究枪里射出的子弹，或树上掉下的苹果，或行星围绕太阳旋转时，必须集中注意在最小可能时间内运动的距离。牛顿之前的很多自然哲学家都遇到了这个问题，想出了种种解决办法，但牛顿在二十几岁的时候就发展出了自己的数学工具来解决这个问题，他称自己的方法是“微分”，是从‘flux’这个词里来的，意思是变化的事物。牛顿的微分所做的计算我们现在仍然在微积分的数学分支中发挥作用。到1666年10月，他为了满足自己的愿望而写了一篇文章，然后就成了欧洲最重要的数学家，但只有牛顿自己知道。他没有直接发表他的数学发现，相反，他使用这种工具，直到最后才将方法和结果与熟悉的人进行了分享。

Besides mathematics, Newton began to investigate light. Since ancient times, it had been assumed that sunlight is white, pure and homogeneous (meaning composed of all the same thing). Colors were thought to be caused by modifications of this essentially pure ray. Newton studied Descartes' work on light and repeated some of his experiments. He used lenses and then a glass object, called a prism, which could break up light. He famously allowed a tiny beam of light into his darkened room, through a prism and then on to the wall twenty-two feet (nearly seven meters) away. If light was homogenous, as Descartes and many others had thought, the projection on the wall ought to be a white circle, the same shape as the hole through which it had passed. Instead, the light appeared as a wide multicolored band. Newton hadn't exactly made a rainbow, but he was on the way to explaining how they are formed. 

除了数学，牛顿还研究了光。自从古代人们就认为阳光是白色的、纯色的、均匀的（意思是由相同的东西组成），颜色是由这种纯色的射线修正后导致的。牛顿研究了笛卡尔关于光的工作，重复了几个他的实验，他使用了镜片，然后使用了一种称为棱镜的玻璃体来研究，棱镜可以分解光线。他做了一个著名的实验，使一小束光进入了他黑暗的房间，光线射入了棱镜，然后射到了22英尺（近7米）外的墙上。如果像笛卡尔和其他人想象的那样，光是均匀的，墙上的投影应该是一个白色的圆环，和光透过的那个小孔应当是一样的，但光最后呈现出了很宽的多色带。牛顿没有将其变成精确的彩虹，但他已经接近其形成机理的解释。

During these plague years, Newton also pushed forward with his work on mechanics: the laws governing bodies in motion. We have seen how Galileo, Kepler, Descartes and others had developed ideas to explain (and write out mathematically) what happens when a cannon-ball is fired, or the earth moves around the sun. Robert Hooke, too, had been interested in this. Newton read the writings of these men, but he also went further. He once wrote to Hooke, ‘If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants’. Do you remember riding on your parent's shoulders? Suddenly being twice or three times as tall reveals all sorts of things you couldn't see by yourself. And that is what Newton was getting at. His wonderful image describes how each scientist, and each generation of scientists, can benefit from the insights of those who came before. This is the essence of science.

在那些瘟疫的年份里，牛顿还在力学上推进了他的工作，提出了物体运动的定律。我们看到过伽利略、开普勒、笛卡尔和其他人怎样提出自己的观点解释（用数学写下）炮弹发射时发生的情况，或者地球围绕太阳转动的情况。Hooke对这个也很感兴趣。牛顿阅读了这些人的著作，但他做了更深的研究。他有一次写信给Hooke，“如果我看的更远，那是因为我站在巨人的肩膀上”。你还记得骑在父母的肩膀上的情形吗？突然变成两倍或者三倍高，就可以看到了各种独自看不到的事情。这就是牛顿到达的高度，他的美妙图画描述了每个科学家、每一代科学家怎样从前人的深刻见解里受益，这就是科学的精髓。

But Newton was also himself a giant, and he knew it. The problems arose when Newton didn't feel that others recognized this. Newton's troubles with Robert Hooke began when Newton offered his very first paper to the Royal Society. The Society did what good scientific journals still do today: they sent it to another expert to comment on. We call this 'peer review', and the process is part of the openness that scientists pride themselves on. The Royal Society chose Hooke to read the paper since he, too, had investigated light. Newton did not like Hooke's comments at all, and even wanted to resign as a Fellow of the Royal Society. The Society quietly ignored his letter of resignation.

但牛顿自己就是个巨人，他也知道。问题发生在，牛顿没有感觉到别人承认他。牛顿与Hooke的问题开始于牛顿向皇家协会提交他的第一篇论文的时候。协会当时把文章送给另一位专家进行评论，好的科学杂志今天还这样做，我们称之为“同行评论”，这个过程是科学开放性的一个表现，科学家们一直以此为荣。皇家协会选择了Hooke阅读这篇文章，因为他也在研究光。牛顿一点也不喜欢Hooke的评论，甚至想辞去皇家协会会员的身份。协会悄悄的忽视了他的辞呈。

Following his amazing burst of creative energy in the 1660s, Newton turned his attention to other matters, including alchemy and theology. As always, he kept careful notes on his reading and experiments, which are still being read by people who want to understand this side of Newton's thinking. At the time, he kept these thoughts and investigations fairly quiet, especially his religious views, which differed from the doctrines of the Church of England. Cambridge University required its students to agree to the Church's beliefs. Fortunately for Newton and for science, he had powerful supporters at the university, so he was able to become a Fellow of Trinity College, and later was even elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, without ever having to swear that he believed in all the Church's doctrines. He held this professorship for more than twenty years. Unfortunately, he was a terrible teacher, and his students couldn't understand what he was talking about. Sometimes, when he arrived, there was nobody to lecture to. He always talked about respectable subjects like light and motion, not the alchemy and theology that he was secretly pursuing - perhaps those would have been more exciting for his students!

17世纪60年代让人吃惊的创新能量大爆发之后，牛顿将注意力转到了其他事物上，包括炼金术和神学。和往常一样，他对阅读的东西和实验都仔细记录笔记，现在想理解牛顿这方面思想的人仍然可以阅读这些笔记。当时，他很安静的保存着这些思想和研究结果，尤其是他的宗教观点，在当时是与英国国教的教义是不一样的。剑桥大学要求学生接受国教的信仰。对牛顿和科学都幸运的是，他在大学里有一些有力的支持者，所以他得意成为三一学院会员，后面甚至被选为数学系的Lucasian教授，都没有被要求宣誓相信所有国教的教义。他保持教授身份长达二十多年。不幸的是，他是个很糟糕的老师，他的学生理解不了他所说的事情。有时候，当他到达教室的时候，发现一个人也没有。他永远在讨论值得尊敬的主题，比如光和运动，而偷偷的从事炼金术和神学的研究，可能这会让他的学生们大感吃惊！

By the mid-1680s, Newton's research into mathematics, physics and astronomy was becoming known. He had written many papers and published a few, but he often remarked that his scientific work was just for himself alone, or for those who came along after his death. In 1684, the astronomer Edmund Halley visited Newton in Cambridge. (Look out for Halley's Comet, named after Edmund Halley, in 2061 when it is next due to be visible from earth.) Halley and Hooke had been discussing the shape of the path taken by one object orbiting around another (such as the earth around the sun, or the moon around the earth). They wondered if gravity would affect the object's path, acting by what we now call the ‘inverse square law’. Gravity is only one of several examples of this law. It means that the force of gravity decreases by the square of the distance between the two objects, and of course, increases in the same ratio as they get closer together. The attraction will be mutual, but the mass of the two objects is also important. If one object - say, the earth - is very large, and the other - say, an apple - is very small, the earth will do almost all the attracting. Chapter 12 explained how Galileo used a 'square' function in his work on falling bodies. We will also see it in later chapters, for Nature does seem to like things to happen as a function of something squared, whether it be time, acceleration or attraction. When you're working with squares (3 x 3 = 9, or 32, for example), remember that Nature might be smiling.

到17世纪80年代中期，牛顿在数学、物理学和天文学方面的研究为众人所知。他写过过很多论文，发表了一些，但他经常说他的科学工作都是为了自己，或者是为了他死后的那些人。1684年，天文学家Edmund Halley在剑桥拜访了牛顿（注意哈雷彗星，就是根据Edmund Halley命名的，2061年将再次从地球上见到）。Halley与Hooke一直在讨论一个物体按轨道绕另一个物体转动时的运动路径（比如地球围绕太阳转动，或者月亮围绕地球转动），他们想知道重力是否会影响物体的路径，我们现在称之为“倒数平方定律”，重力是这个定律的一个例子。其意思是重力随两个物体距离增加的平方而减少，当然，当靠近时，也会以平方的速度增加。引力是相互的，但两个物体的重量也很重要，如果一个物体，比如地球非常，而另一个物体，比如苹果，非常小，那么基本上是地球在吸引苹果。第12章解释了伽利略怎样在自由落体中使用了平方的函数，我们在后面章节中还会见到，因为自然确实似乎喜欢事情以平方的规律发生，可以是时间、加速度或者引力。当你遇到平方时，记得自然可能在微笑。

Halley's visit made Newton put aside his theology and alchemy. He set to work and produced his greatest book, one of the most important in the history of science, even if it is not an easy read. Today it is known as the Principia but its full Latin title (Newton wrote it in Latin) is Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica ('Mathematical principles of natural philosophy': remember 'natural philosophy' was the old name for science). Newton's book gave the full details of how his new mathematics could be applied, and explained many aspects of physical nature in numbers rather than wordy descriptions. Only a few people could understand it easily in Newton's lifetime, but its message was appreciated much more widely. It was a new way to see and describe the universe.

Halley的拜访使得牛顿放下了神学和炼金学。他开始工作，造就了他的大作，科学史上最重要的著作之一，即使读起来没那么容易。今天我们称之为《基本原理》，书名全称是《自然哲学的数学原理》。牛顿的书完全阐述了他的新数学思想是如何应用的，用数字，而不是语言描述多角度解释了自然的物理特性。牛顿终其一生，只有几个人能理解，但其中的信息很多人都领会到了。这是看待和描述这个宇宙的全新方法。

Many aspects of Newton's view of the world and the heavens were contained in his three famous laws of motion, which he wrote in the Principia. His first law stated that every body either stays at rest or moves in a straight line unless something else - some force - acts upon it. A rock on a mountainside will stay there forever unless something - wind, rain, a human being - causes it to move; and, without any disturbance ('friction'), it would move in a straight line forever.

牛顿关于世界和天空的观点都包含在他著名的运动三定律中，写在上面那本书中。第一定律是说，如果没有外力作用，所有物体都会保持静止，或保持匀速直线运动。山坡上的一块石头会永远在那里，除非有风、雨，或者人使它移动，如果没有外力（摩擦力），它会永远直线运动。

His second law stated that if something is already moving, a force can change its direction. How great the change depends on the strength of the force, and the change of direction occurs along a straight line, in the direction of the new force. So, if you swat a falling balloon from the side, it will move sideways; if you swat it from above, it will go down more quickly.

第二定律说，如果物体在运动，外力可以改变其方向。改变的程度根据力的不同而不同，改变的方向也是沿着外力的直线方向。所以，如果拍打一个下落的气球，它会移向一边；如果从上面拍打，它会加速下降。

His third law of motion concluded that for any action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction. This means that two bodies always act upon each other equally but in opposite directions. You can swat a balloon, and it will move away from your hand, but it will also deliver an action on your hand (you will feel it). If you swat a large boulder, the boulder won't move, but your hand may bounce back, and it will be sore. This is because it is harder for lightweight objects to influence heavy ones than vice versa. (We saw that it was the same with gravity.)

第三运动定律是说，有力必有反作用力。这意思是说两个物体相互作用，其作用力相等，但方向相反。你可以拍打一个气球，气球会从你手中移走，但它也会给你的手一个作用力（你可以感觉到）。如果你拍一个大卵石，石头不会移动，但你的手可能会弹回来，会酸疼，这是因为轻量级的物体很难影响更重的物体，反之亦然（我们看到了，对于重力是一样的）。

These three laws brought together the puzzles of earlier natural philosophers. In Newton's hands, they explained many observations, from the movements of the planets to the trajectory of an arrow shot from a bow. The laws of motion made it possible to view the whole universe as a giant, regular machine, like a watch that keeps time because of its springs, levers and movements. Newton's Principia was recognized as a work of great power and genius. It turned this reclusive, troubled man into something of a celebrity. His reward was a well-paid post as the Warden of the Mint, the place where the government made its coins and regulated the country's supply of money. Newton threw himself into this new job with great gusto, tracking down counterfeiters and overseeing the nation's money supply. He had to move to London, so he resigned all his Cambridge connections and spent the last thirty years of his life in the capital, becoming President of the Royal Society.

这三定律解决了很多早期自然哲学家的疑惑。在牛顿的手里，它们解释了很多观察结果，从行星的运动，到弓射出的箭的轨道。运动定律使人们有可能将整个宇宙看做一个巨大的有规律的机器，就像一块手表可以计时是因为有弹簧、杠杆和运动。牛顿的《基本原理》被看做是天才之作，使这位隐居的麻烦的人成为了一定意义上的明星。他得到的回报是成为了造币厂的看守人，待遇丰厚，造币厂是政府制造硬币的地方，规范全国的货币供应。牛顿以极大的热情接受了这个工作，追踪假币制造者，监督全国货币供应。他不得不移居伦敦，所以他辞去了所有剑桥的职务，最后三十年都在首都度过，成为了皇家协会的主席。

During his London years, Newton significantly revised the Principia, including some of his further work, as well as answering various criticisms that people had raised since its publication. Scientists often do this. Not long after Robert Hooke died, Newton published his second major scientific work, Opticks (1704), about light. Newton and Hooke had quarreled a lot over which of them had done what first and how to understand the results of their experiments into what light was and how it behaved. Newton had done much of the work for this book nearly forty years earlier, but he had been reluctant to publish it while Hooke was alive. Like Principia, Opticks was very important. We'll encounter some of its conclusions in later chapters, when other scientists were standing on Newton's shoulders.

在伦敦的时间里，牛顿对《基本原理》进行了大幅修改，加入了他的进一步工作，也回答了自从出版以来人们的众多批评。科学家经常做这些。Hooke去世后不久，牛顿发表了他第二部主要科学著作，《光学》（1704），有关光的科学。在谁第一个做了相关工作，以及如何理解他们的实验结果，以及光是什么，行为规律是什么，牛顿和Hooke有过很多争论。牛顿在四十年前就做了书中所述的大部分工作，但他不愿发表在Hooke活着的时候发表它。就像《基本原理》一样，《光学》也非常重要。我们在后续章节中会遇到其结论，那时其他科学家将会踩在牛顿的肩膀上。

Newton was the first scientist to be knighted, becoming Sir Isaac. He enjoyed power but not much happiness. He was not what one would call a nice man, but he was a great one, one of the most truly creative scientists who has ever lived, celebrated for the amazing contributions he made to our understanding of the universe. Newton's Principia was the highpoint of the astronomy and physics that had been so actively pursued by Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and many others. In his book, Newton brought the heavens and earth together in one system, for his laws applied throughout the universe. He offered mathematical and physical explanations of the way the planets move and the way bodies fall towards the earth. He provided the foundations of physics that scientists used until the twentieth century, when Einstein and others showed that there was more to the universe than even Sir Isaac had imagined.

牛顿是第一个被授以爵位的科学家，成为Isaac爵士。他享受权势，但并没有什么开心。他不是人们常说的好人，但他是一个伟大的人，最有创造力的科学家之一，对理解这个宇宙做出了惊人的贡献。牛顿的《基本原理》是天文学和物理学的制高点，开普勒、伽利略、笛卡尔和其他很多科学家都孜孜追求过。在他的书中，牛顿将地球与天体纳入一个体系，因为他的定律宇宙通用。他为行星运动和苹果掉落提出了数学和物理解释，他提出的物理学基础科学家一直用到了20世纪，那时爱因斯坦和其他科学家向大家展示了宇宙比Isaac爵士想象的还要更复杂。

# CHAPTER 17 Bright Sparks
# 第17章 明亮的火花

Have you ever wondered exactly what a flash of lightning is, and why a rumble of thunder follows? Violent displays of thunder and lightning happen high up in the sky, and are pretty dramatic, even if you know what causes them. Just as bolts of lightning always seek earth, by the early eighteenth century scientists had started to puzzle over this and about electricity much closer to home.

你想知道闪电到底是什么吗？为什么会紧随着一声雷？高空中出现电闪雷鸣的剧烈表演，非常引人注目，即使知道原因也是这样。闪电永远打向地上，到18世纪早期，科学家开始对这个现象感到困惑，后来则对电的现象也感到这样。

Another puzzle was over what came to be known as magnetism. The ancient Greeks knew that if you rub amber (a yellowish semi-precious stone) very hard, it attracts small nearby objects to it. The cause of this power was difficult to understand. It seemed different from the constant power of a different kind of stone - the lodestone - to attract objects containing iron. Just as a lodestar is a star that shows the way (especially the Northern Star), so the lodestone also guided travelers: it was a piece of a special mineral that, if suspended so that it could swing freely, would always point towards the magnetic poles. Lodestones could also be used to magnetize needles, and by the time of Copernicus, in the mid-sixteenth century, crude compasses were being used by seamen to help find their direction, since one end of the moveable needle of the compass always pointed to the north. An English doctor named William Gilbert wrote about this in 1600, when the word 'magnetism' had arrived. Both electricity and magnetism could produce entertaining effects and were popular topics for scientific lectures as well as after-dinner games.

另一个谜题是后来称为磁性的现象。古希腊知道，如果使劲摩擦琥珀（一种黄色的次宝石），就会吸引周围的物体。这种力量的原因难以理解。而另一种石头，天然磁石，则一直有这种吸引含铁的物质的力量，这和前面的琥珀不太一样。北极星是一种指引方向的星星，天然磁石同样可以为旅者指路：天然磁石是一种特殊矿物质，如果处于悬浮状态，可以自由旋转，那它永远会指向磁极的方向。天然磁石可以用于磁化指针，到哥白尼的时代，大约16世纪中期，海员就会用粗糙的指南针帮助他们确定方向，因为指南针的可移动针头永远指向北方。1600年一个英国医生William Gilbert记下了这个现象，这时也出现了“磁性”这个词。电与磁都可以制造出娱乐的效果，这在科学讲座和饭后游戏中都是非常流行的话题。

Soon, people obtained even more powerful effects by rotating a glass globe on a point and rubbing it as it turned. You could feel and even hear the sparks as they were produced on the glass. This device became the basis of what was called the Leyden Jar, named after the town in the Netherlands where it was invented, in about 1745, by a professor at the university. The jar was half filled with water and connected to an electricity-generating machine by a wire. The connecting piece was called the 'conductor' because it allowed the mysterious power to pass into the water in the jar, where it was stored. ('To conduct' means 'to lead'.) When a laboratory assistant touched the side of the jar and the conducting piece, he got such a jolt that he thought it was all over for him. The report of this experiment caused a sensation and Leyden Jars became all the rage. Ten monks once linked hands and when the first one touched the jar and conducting piece, they were all jolted simultaneously. An electric shock, it seemed, could be passed from person to person.

很快，人们通过在一个点上旋转一个玻璃球，并在转动的时候摩擦，得到了更强大的效果，你可以感受到甚至听到玻璃产生的火花。这种装置成为了后来称为莱顿瓶的基础。莱顿瓶由一位大学教授在大约1745年在荷兰的一个市镇发明，瓶子是以镇子的名字命名的。瓶子里装了一半水，通过线连接到发电机。连接的线称之为导体，因为它可以让这种神秘的力量进入瓶中的水里，并存储在水里。当实验室助理触碰到瓶子的一端和那个导体，他感到震动，认为那种力量都跑到了他身上。这个实验的报道引起了轰动，莱顿瓶大为风行。有一次请了十位僧人手握手站在一起，第一个人碰到了瓶子和导体时，所有人都同时感到了震动，看起来好像电击可以从人传到人身上。

What exactly was going on? Beyond the games, there were serious scientific issues at stake. There were a lot of theories flying about, but one man who brought some order to the subject was Benjamin Franklin (1706-90). You might know him as an early American patriot who helped write the Declaration of Independence (1776) after the United States successfully achieved its independence from the British Empire. He was a witty, popular man, full of homespun wisdom, such as 'Time is money', and ‘In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes’. Next time you sit in a rocking chair, or see someone wearing bifocal glasses, think of him: he invented them both.

到底发生了什么？游戏之外，有迫切需要解决的严肃的科学问题。这时出现了很多理论，但有一个人的理论让大家都觉得比较信服，他就是Benjamin Franklin(1706-90)。你可能知道他是一个美国早期爱国人士，美国从大英帝国独立出来后他参与撰写了独立宣言(1776)。他是一个诙谐的，受人欢迎的人，充满了朴素的智慧，比如“时间就是金钱”，以及“这世上什么都不是确定的，除了死亡和交税”。下次你坐在一个摇椅上，或者看到谁双焦眼镜，记得想起他，这都是他发明的。

Largely self-taught, Franklin knew a lot about a lot of things, including science. He felt equally at home in France, Britain and America, and he was in France when he performed his most famous scientific experiment, with lightning. Like many people in the 1740s and 1750s, Franklin was curious about Leyden Jars and what they could show. In his hands, they showed far more than had been thought. First, he realized that things could carry either positive or negative charges- as you can see marked by the'+' and'-' at the opposite ends of a battery. In the Leyden Jar, the connecting wire and the water inside the jar were 'electrized positively, or plus', he said, while the outer surface was negative. The positive and negative were the same strength and so cancelled each other out. Further experiments convinced him that the Jar's actual power lay in the glass, and he made a kind of battery (he invented the word) by placing a piece of glass between two strips of lead. When he connected his device to a source of electricity, this 'battery' could be charged of electricity. Unfortunately, he did not pursue this discovery any further.

富兰克林基本上是自学的，但他对很多事情都深入研究过，包括科学。他在法国、英国和美国都一样自在，他进行著名的闪电实验时，是在法国。和十八世纪四五十年代的很多人一样，他对莱顿瓶和那些表演也很好奇，在他的手里，更是出现了难以想象的展示。首先，他意识到物体可以带正电荷或负电荷，就像你在电池两端看到的‘+’和‘-’一样。他说莱顿瓶里的导体和水被充上了正电荷，而外表面充满了负电荷。正负电荷数量一样多，所以可以互相抵消。进一步的实验使人们相信，瓶子真正的力量在于玻璃瓶，他发明了一种电池（这个词也是他发明的），在两块锡片中间放入一块玻璃。当他将这个装置与电源相连接时，这个电池就可以被充电。不过他并没有更深入的进行实验。

Franklin was not the first to puzzle about the relationship between the sparks generated by machines on earth and sparks in the sky, that is, lightning. But he was the first to apply what he had learned about the Leyden Jar to try to see how they might be connected. He devised a clever (but dangerous) experiment. He argued that electricity in the atmosphere would collect on the edge of clouds, just as it did in the Leyden Jar. If two clouds collided with each other, as they rolled across the sky during a thunderstorm, there would be a discharge of electricity - a flash of lightning. By flying a kite during such a storm, he could show that his idea was correct. The person flying the kite needed to be properly insulated from the electricity (by using a wax handle to hold the kite-string) and 'grounded' (with a piece of wire attached to him and trailing on the ground). Without these precautions, the shock of the electricity might kill him, and indeed, one unfortunate experimenter did die because he didn't follow Franklin's instructions. The kite experiment convinced Franklin that the electricity of lightning was like the electricity of Leyden Jars.

机器产生的电火花和天上闪电的火花到底是什么关系？富兰克林不是第一个对其感到困惑的人，但他是第一个用莱顿瓶来研究其关系的人。他设计了一个聪明但危险的实验，他认为大气中的电荷会在云端汇集，就像莱顿瓶中的一样。如果在雷暴的时候，两片云碰到了一起，那么就会产生放电现象，这就是闪电。在这样的暴风雨天如果放一个风筝，那么就可以证明其观点是正确的。放风筝的人必须妥善的进行绝缘处理（通过使用涂蜡的把手来握住风筝线）和接地处理（身上连接导线并拖到地上），没有这些预防措施，电击可能就会杀死他，确实，有一个不幸的实验者因为没有遵循富兰克林的说明就死了。风筝实验使富兰克林相信闪电中的电和莱顿瓶中的电是一样的。

First gravity, now electricity: things in the heavens and on earth were being brought ever closer together.

首先是重力，现在是电，天上的东西和地上的东西越来越紧密联系到一起。

Franklin's work on electricity had immediate practical consequences. He showed that a metal pole with a sharp point conducted electricity to the ground. So, if such a pole were placed on the top of a building, with an insulated conducting body leading from it all the way down to the earth, lightning would be conducted away from the building, and it would not catch fire if struck by the lightning. This was a serious problem when houses were built mostly of wood and sometimes had thatched roofs. Lightning rods, as they are still called, act on this principle, and even now we use the word 'earth' for the bit of insulated wire in our electric plugs that takes away excessive electrical charge in things like washing machines and refrigerators. Franklin connected a lightning rod on his own house, and the idea caught on. There were important results to be had from understanding electricity.

富兰克林关于电的工作立刻有了实际结果。他展示了一个尖端的金属棒可以将电导入大地，所以如果将这样的金属棒放到建筑物最上面，并用绝缘处理的导体将其导引下去，直到大地，闪电将会从建筑物上传导出去，所以即使建筑物被闪电击中，也不会着火。当时很多房子是木头盖的，还是茅草的房顶，所以这是个很严肃的问题。避雷针就是根据这个原则设计的，即使是现在我们在电插头中还可以看到地线的标志，用来将洗衣机或冰箱中多余的电荷导出。富兰克林将避雷针状到了自己的房间上，这个主意开始流行起来。理解了电之后，有了很重要的结果。

The study of electricity was one of the most exciting areas of scientific research in the eighteenth century, and many 'electricians', as they were called, contributed to what we know today. Three in particular have left their names with us. The first was Luigi Galvani (1737-98), a doctor who liked to tinker with electrical apparatus and animals. He practiced medicine and taught both anatomy and obstetrics (the medical management of childbirth) at the University of Bologna, but he was also much interested in physiological studies. While investigating the relation between muscles and nerves, he discovered that a frog's muscle could be made to contract if the nerve attached to it were connected to a source of electricity. After further research, he likened muscle to a Leyden Jar, able to generate and discharge a current of electricity. Electricity was an important part of animals, Galvani said. Indeed, 'animal electricity', as he termed it, seemed to him to be an essential ingredient of how animals functioned. And he was right.

18世纪时关于电的研究是最令人兴奋的科学领域之一，这些人被称为“电气技师”，为很多今天我们所知的东西做出了贡献。有三个人为我们所知。第一个是Luigi Galvani (1737-98)，他是一个喜欢摆弄电气设备和小动物的医生。他行医的同时，还在Bologna大学教授解剖学和助产术，但他还对生理学研究非常感兴趣。在研究肌肉和神经的关系的时，他发现如果将青蛙的神经通电，那么相连的肌肉就会收缩。进一步研究后，他将肌肉比作莱顿瓶，可以发电，也可以放电。Galvani说，电是动物的重要部分，他将其称为“动物电”，似乎是动物器官发挥作用的基本组成部分，确实，他是正确的。

Static electric shocks, which occur when electricity that has built up on the surface of an object is discharged, are still called galvanic shocks. Scientists and electricians use galvanometers to measure electric currents. Galvani's notion of animal electricity attracted a good deal of criticism, especially from Alessandro Volta (1757-1827), a scientist from Como in northern Italy. Volta had a low opinion of doctors who branched out into physics, and he set out to show that animal electricity did not exist. Volta and Galvani had a very public debate about the interpretation of Galvani's experiments. In the course of his extensive work aimed at discrediting Galvani, Volta examined the electric eel, which, as could be demonstrated, did produce electricity. He believed that even these animals did not make Galvani's 'animal electricity' more convincing. More importantly, Volta discovered that if he built up successive layers of zinc and sliver, and separated them by layers of wet cardboard, he could produce a continuous electric current through all the layers. Volta sent news of his invention, which he called a ‘pile’, to the Royal Society in London. Like the Leyden Jar, it created a sensation in England and France.

静电电击，当物体表面累积的电荷放电时就会发生，现在仍然称为触电（Galvanic，以前节人名形成的单词）电击。科学家和电气技师用电流计来测量电流。Galvani动物电的概念引来了很多批评，尤其是Alessandro Volta (1757-1827)，他是北意大利Como的一个科学家。Volta很看不起研究物理的医生，他着手开始展示动物电并不存在。Volta和Galvani非常公开的对Galvani的实验解释进行了辩论。在试图破坏Galvani信任的冗长的过程中，Volta对电鳗进行了实验，电鳗确实是可以产生电力的。他相信即使是这种动物也不能使Galvani的动物电概念更使人信服。更重要的是，Volta发现，如果他连续的叠加锌层和银层，层与层之间用湿的硬纸板隔开，就可以在所有层之间产生持续的电流。Volta称之为“电池组”(pile)，并将新发明的消息发送给了伦敦皇家协会。像莱顿瓶一样，这在法国和英国产生了轰动。

At this time, France was busy conquering northern Italy, and the French Emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, decorated the Italian physicist for his invention, for it offered a reliable source of electric currents for experimental research. Volta's 'pile' went on to play an essential part in early nineteenth-century chemistry. It was the practical development of Franklin's ‘battery’, and has become essential in our lives today. We remember Volta because his name gave us the word 'volt' which is one way we measure electrical power - check out the packaging next time you change a battery.

这个时候，法国正忙着征服北意大利，法国皇帝拿破仑因为他的发明给这个意大利物理学家授勋，因为这个发明为科学实验提供了可靠的电流来源。Volta的电池组在19世纪早期的化学中仍然扮演重要角色。这是富兰克林电池概念的实际发展，在现代生活中已经是必不可少。我们还铭记Volta还因为他的名字衍生出了volt，这是我们测量电力的一种方式，下次换电池的时候可以看看包装。

Our third great electrician (and formidable mathematician) also gave his name to the measurement of electricity: Andre-Marie Ampere (1775-1836). We get the word 'amp' from his name. Ampere lived through the trauma of the French Revolution and its aftermath, during which his father lost his head on the guillotine. His personal life was equally sad. His beloved first wife died after the birth of their third child, and his second marriage was deeply unhappy and ended in divorce. His children turned out badly, and he was constantly beset with money worries. In the middle of this chaos, Ampere realized some fundamental things about mathematics, chemistry and, above all, what he called ‘electrodynamics’. This complicated subject brought together electricity and magnetism. Despite its complexity, Ampere's simple but elegant experiments showed that magnetism was in fact electricity in motion. His work underpinned that of Faraday and Maxwell, and so we will talk about it in more detail when we come to these later giants of electromagnetism. Although later scientists showed that many of the details of Ampere's theories did not lead anywhere, he provided the starting point for much research into electromagnetism. It is important to remember that science is also about sometimes getting things wrong.

第三个电气技师（还是个强大的数学家）也将其名字贡献给了电流测量，Andre-Marie Ampere (1775-1836)，安培就是来源于他的名字。Ampere生活在法国大革命的创伤和余波中，他的父亲上了断头台，他本人的生活也很悲哀，他的爱妻生了第三个孩子后也死了，二婚非常不愉快，然后离婚了。他的孩子变得很坏，他也一直为钱所困扰。在这些混乱中，他意识到一些非常基本的东西，不止是关于数学、化学，还是关于他称为“电动力学”的。这个复杂的主题包括了电学和磁学，尽管很复杂，Ampere简单而优雅的实验展示了磁性实际上由运动的电流产生的，Faraday和Maxwell巩固了他的工作，我们在后面的章节遇到这些电磁学的巨人的时候再讨论细节。虽然后世的科学家指出很多Ampere的理论的细节没什么作用，但他还是为电磁学的研究开了一个头。重要的是要记得，科学总是要有人试错的。

By the time of Ampere's death, electricity had gone a long way towards being tamed. Franklin's work had been homespun and, important though it was, he was an ingenious amateur compared with Galvani, Volta and Ampere, who used more sophisticated equipment, and worked in laboratories. Galvani had the last laugh on Volta, for we now know that electricity plays an important part when muscles and nerves interact.

Ampere去世的时候，人们在驯化电力方面已经走了很远。富兰克林的工作尽管朴素但是非常重要，与Galvani，Volta，Ampere比起来，他是一个天才的业余爱好者，而那些人都是在实验室用复杂的设备进行工作。Galvani最后笑过了Volta，因为我们知道，电在肌肉与神经互动时确实起着很重要的作用。

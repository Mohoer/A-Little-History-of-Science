# CHAPTER 22 Forces, Fields and Magnetism
# 第22章 力，场和磁性

Dalton's atom helped create modern chemistry, but there were other ways of looking at atoms. For a start, they could do much more than just combine to make compounds. Atoms don't simply enter into chemical reactions. Both Davy and Berzelius had cleverly used the fact that atoms in a solution can be attracted to the positive or negative poles if an electric current is passed through the solution: atoms were part of 'electricity', too. In a solution of seawater, why would the sodium migrate to the negative pole, and the chlorine to the positive?

Dalton的原子理论帮助建立了现在化学，但还有其他看待原子的方式。首先，原子可以做的事非常多，不止是结合而形成化合物。原子并不是简单的进入化学反应。Davy和Berzelius都聪明的使用了这样一个事实，当溶液通电时，溶液中的原子可以被吸引到正极和负极上，这也就是说，原子还是“电”的一部分。在海水溶液中，为什么钠原子迁移到负极，氯原子迁移到正极呢？

Such questions were hotly debated in the early nineteenth century. One of the chief investigators was Michael Faraday (1791-1867). Faraday was a quite remarkable man. Born into an ordinary family, he received only a basic education. He spent his youth learning bookbinding, but he discovered science and spent his spare time reading anything he could find about it. A popular children's book on chemistry fired his imagination, and a customer at the bookbinder's shop where he worked offered him a ticket to hear one of Humphry Davy's talks at the Royal Institution. Faraday listened in rapture and took careful notes in his neat handwriting. Ever keen, he showed his notes to Davy, who was impressed by their accuracy, but he advised Faraday that there were no jobs in science, and bookbinding was a better trade for a man who needed to make a living.

这样的问题在19世纪初期得到了热烈了辩论。其中一个主要研究者是Michael Faraday (1791-1867)。Faraday是一个非常杰出的人，他生于一个普通家庭，仅仅受到了基础教育。他年轻时学的是书籍装订，但他发现了科学，利用业余时间阅读任何能够找到的相关东西。一本流行儿童化学书籍点燃了他的想象力，他工作的书籍装订店的一位顾客给了他一张票，他去听了皇家协会里Humphry Davy的一场演讲。Faraday兴高采烈的去听了，用整洁的笔迹小心的做了记录。他非常热心，将记录给Davy进行了展示，Davy对其记录精度印象深刻，但他告诉Faraday，科学里没有工作给他，对于一个需要谋生的人来说，书籍装订更适合他。

Shortly afterwards, however, a laboratory assistant at the Royal Institution was sacked, and Davy offered Faraday the job. He stayed there the rest of his life, helping to make it a profitable place with a great reputation. Faraday's early days at the Institution were spent in solving chemical problems for Davy. Faraday excelled in the laboratory, but he continued to read about more general scientific problems. He was a devout member of a particular group of Protestants; he devoted many hours to his Church, and his religious belief also guided his scientific enquiries. Quite simply, he thought that God had created the universe the way it is, but that human beings were capable of understanding how it all fits together.

但此后不久，皇家协会的一位实验室助理被解雇了，Davy将这个工作给了Faraday。此后他一直待在那里，将这里变成了一个有利可图的地方，同时名声也特别好。Faraday在协会早期的日子里在帮助Davy解决化学问题。Faraday在实验室里超越了他人，但他继续阅读更一般的科学问题。他是新教中一个特殊团体的虔诚会员，他很多时间都花在了教堂里，他的宗教信仰指引了他的科学探索。很简单，他认为上帝就是这样创造了宇宙，但人类可以理解这一切是怎样拼装在一起的。

Shortly after Faraday joined the Royal Institution, Davy and his new wife went on a tour of Europe, and they took Faraday with them. Davy's aristocratic wife treated Faraday as a servant, but the eighteen-month tour allowed Faraday to meet many of the leading scientific figures in Europe. Returning to London, Faraday and Davy continued to work on many practical problems: what caused explosions in mines; how the copper bottoms of ships could be improved; what were the optical characteristics of glass? As Davy became increasingly concerned with scientific politics, so Faraday became increasingly his own master, turning his attention to the relationship between electricity and magnetism.

Faraday加入皇家协会后不久，Davy和新妻子到欧洲进行了旅行，并带上了Faraday。Davy的贵族妻子将Faraday视作仆人，但18个月的旅行使Faraday见到了欧洲很多科学界领导人物。回到伦敦后，Faraday和Davy在很多实际问题上继续工作：什么导致了矿井爆炸？船体的铜质底部如何改进？玻璃的光学特性是怎样的？随着Davy逐渐关心起科学政治，Faraday越来越可以自己做主，将注意力转移到了电和磁的关系上。

In 1820, the Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851) had discovered electromagnetism: the manipulation of an electric current so that it creates a magnetic ‘field’. Magnetism had long been known, and the compass, with its iron needle always pointing north, is still useful. Navigators had used compasses long before Columbus discovered America, and natural philosophers had puzzled over why only a few substances (such as iron) could be magnetized. Most things could not. The fact that compasses always pointed in the same direction meant that the earth itself acted as a huge magnet.

在1820年，丹麦物理学家Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851)发现了电磁现象，对电流进行操作会产生磁“场”。磁现象一直都为人所知，指南针的铁针一直指向北方仍然有用，导航员在哥伦布发现美洲之前就使用指南针很久了，自然哲学家想知道为什么只有一部分物质（比如铁）可以磁化，而大多数物质都不可以。指南针永远指向相同的方向，这意味着地球本身就是一个巨大的磁体。

Oersted's electromagnetism created a wave of scientific interest, and Faraday took up the challenge. In September 1821, he devised one of the most famous experiments in scientific history. Working with a small magnetic needle, he saw that the needle would continue to spin round if it was surrounded by wires carrying an electric current. While the electricity flowed through the coiled wire, it created a magnetic field to which the needle was continually attracted - spinning round and round. This was the result of what Faraday called ‘lines of force’, and he realized its significance. What he had done, for the first time, was to convert electrical energy (electricity) into mechanical energy (the movement or power of the rotating needle). He had invented the principle of all our electrical motors. These too convert electricity into power, in washing machines, CD players or vacuum cleaners.

Oersted的电磁学产生了一波科学兴趣，Faraday接受了这个挑战。1821年9月，他设计了科学史上最著名的实验之一。他工作中用到了一个小小的磁针，他发现，如果磁针被通电的导线环绕，那么磁针就会不断旋转。当电流通过缠绕成线圈的导线时，产生了磁场，这不断的吸引着磁针，旋转不停。这就是Faraday称之为“线力”的结果，他意识到了其重要性。他所做的，是第一次，把电力（电流）转化为机械力量（磁针旋转产生的力量）。他发现了所有电动发动机的原理，这也是将洗衣机中、CD唱机或真空吸尘器中将电转化为能的原理。

Faraday continued to work with electricity and magnetism for the next thirty years. He was one of the most gifted experimenters who ever lived: thoughtful about planning his work and careful in carrying it out. His self-education had not included mathematics, so his scientific papers read much like his laboratory notebooks: detailed descriptions of his equipment, what he did and what he observed. His work also helped scientists understand the role of electrical charges in chemical reactions. By the early 1830s, he had added the electrical generator and the electrical transformer to his inventions. He made his electrical generator by moving a permanent magnet in and out of a coiled wire, which creates an electric current. To make his transformer, he passed an electric current through a wire wound around an iron ring, which caused a brief electrical current in another wire, wound around the opposite face of the ring. Faraday knew these experiments were crude, but he also knew he was on to something very important. The relationship between electricity and magnetism, and the conversion of electrical energy to mechanical energy, literally drive our modern world.

Faraday后面三十年时间都放在电与磁的研究中。他是最有天才的实验者之一：合理设计实验，小心进行实验。他没有自学数学，所以他的科学论文读起来很像实验室笔记：对他实验设备、他做的东西、他观察到的东西的详细描述。他的工作也帮助科学家理解电荷在化学实验中的角色。到19世纪30年代，他已经将发电机和变压器引入到实验中。他让一块永磁体不断进出线圈，所以能产生电流，从而制造出发电机；他在铁环上缠上线圈，并对线圈通电，在铁环的另一面也缠上线圈，这个线圈里也产生了电流，但是和原电流强度不同，这就产生了变压器。Faraday知道这些实验很粗糙，但他也知道他正在做一些很重要的事。电与磁的关系，以及电能转化为机械能，确实在驱动我们的现代世界。

Faraday kept up his broad scientific interests, and spent much time sitting on scientific committees and running the Royal Institution. He started the Institution's Christmas Lectures, which are still hugely popular today - you may have seen one on the television. But electricity and magnetism remained his chief love. His fascination left us with a new vocabulary and many useful applications. He even made jokes about his inventions. When asked by a politician of the practical value of electricity, he is supposed to have said, 'Why, sir, there is every probability that you will soon be able to tax it!'

Faraday一直保持着广泛的科学兴趣，花了很多时间参加科学团体，保持皇家协会的运转。他开启了皇家协会圣诞讲座，今天仍然广受欢迎，你可能在电视上看过一期。但电和磁仍然是他的主要爱好，他留给了我们很多新词汇，以及很多应用。他甚至还对他的发明开玩笑，当一个政客问他电的实际用处，据说他这样说：“先生，你很有可能很快就对它征税！”

Across the Atlantic, another world-changing upshot of the great interest in electricity and magnetism appeared: the electric telegraph. Sending signals through electric wires started in the early 1800s, but the American Samuel Morse (1792-1872) developed the first long-distance telegraph. In 1844 he sent a message over thirty-eight miles (using the Morse Code that bears his name) from Washington, DC, to Baltimore. Telegraphic communication quickly developed all over the world, and the British used it to connect the outposts in their far-flung empire. It was now possible for people to communicate quickly with each other, and for news to be reported soon after it happened.

对电磁的巨大兴趣使另一个横跨大西洋改变世界的结果出现了：电报。19世纪初期人们就开始用电线传送信号，美国人Samuel Morse (1792-1872)发明了第一个长距离电报。1844年，他从华盛顿将信息传送到了巴尔的摩，距离有38英里（用以他名字命名的莫尔斯电码）。电报通信迅速传遍全世界，大英帝国用电报来连接帝国里广泛分布的前哨站。人们现在可以迅速互相通信，新闻发生后，很快就可以被报道。

Faraday came up with the idea of a 'field' of action to explain why electricity and magnetism had their amazing properties. Fields (areas of influence) had been used by scientists before as they tried to explain the mysteries of chemical reactions, electricity, magnetism, light and gravity. These things took place, they thought, in a particular space or field, just as different games are played on a specific court, pitch or field. Faraday made this idea central to his explanation of electricity and magnetism, arguing that the important thing was to measure the area of activity rather than worry too much about what electricity, light or magnetism actually were. But the force of an electric field could be shown in experiments.

Faraday想出一种“场”的概念来解释电磁为什么有这样的性质。以前的科学家曾经用场（在一定范围内有影响）来尝试解释化学实验、电、磁、光和引力，他们认为，这些现象都发生在一种特殊空间或场中，就像在特殊的场地进行不同的游戏一样。Faraday主要用这种思想来解释电磁现象，他认为不要担心电、光或者磁到底是什么，重要的是测量它们的作用范围。电场的力可以在实验中展示出来。

Faraday could not believe that something like gravity could exert its influence through a vacuum. Faraday solved this by assuming that there was no such thing as absolute emptiness. Rather, he argued, space was filled with a very refined substance that was called the ‘aether’. This aether (it's nothing to do with ether, the anesthetic gas) made it possible for physicists and chemists to explain lots of things by direct influence. Thus, Faraday's 'fields' around electric currents or magnets could be the result of the current or magnet stimulating the very refined matter that constituted the aether. Gravity was easier to explain in this way, too: otherwise it seemed to be some strange occult force like the magical powers of the older alchemists, something that moderns like Faraday did not believe in. The aether was not something you could see, or feel, but physicists thought it explained the results of their experiments. In Britain, they continued to use the aether idea until the early 1900s, when experiments showed that it did not actually exist.

Faraday不相信像引力可以通过真空施加其影响。Faraday假设没有绝对真空，这样就解决了问题，他假设空间充满了一种微妙的物质，叫做“以太”。这种以太（这和乙醚这种麻醉气体毫无关系，其英文单词非常相似）直接使物理学家和化学家可以解释很多事情。所以，电流或磁体周围的Faraday的“场”就是电流或磁体激励了周围的这个以太的结果。重力通过这种方式也更容易进行解释：否则这就像古时的炼金术士所说的某些神秘力量一样，这是Faraday这样的现代人不会相信的。以太看不到，感觉不到，但物理学家认为它可以解释其实验结果。在英国，以太的概念一直用到20世纪初，到那时通过实验证明了其并不存在。

Much of Faraday's work on forces proved more useful. Later physicists extended it and provided better mathematical descriptions of electricity, magnetism and the many other phenomena that the physical world throws up when explored. Faraday was the last great physicist who didn't use mathematics.

Faraday在力上的工作大部分都被证明更有用些。后世的物理学家进行了拓展，为电、磁以及进一步探索时物理世界抛出的很多其他现象都提供了更好的数学描述。Faraday是最后一个没有使用数学的物理学家。

The man who truly secured Faraday's legacy was James Clerk Maxwell (1831-79), one of the new breed of mathematical physicists. Maxwell is often spoken of in the same breath as Newton and Einstein. He was certainly one of the most creative physicists of all time. He was born in Edinburgh and educated there until he went to Cambridge University. He returned briefly to Scotland to teach, but in 1860 went to King's College, London. There he spent some of his most productive years. He had already described the rings of the planet Saturn, but in London he developed a theory of color and took the first color photograph. He was always interested in electricity and magnetism, and brought them firmly together: after Maxwell, physicists could use mathematics to describe electromagnetism. Maxwell provided the mathematical tools and equations to describe Faraday's ideas of the field. His equations showed that the electromagnetic force is a wave, and this was one of the most important discoveries in the whole of physics. This wave travels at the speed of light, and we now know that the light and energy from the sun come to us as electromagnetic waves. Indeed, Maxwell predicted the entire range of waves that we know: radio waves which allow radio broadcasts, microwaves in our kitchens, ultraviolet and infrared light waves above and below the colors of the rainbow, as well as X- rays and gamma waves, or rays. These waves are now part of everyday life. Yet most of these forms of energy were still to be discovered when Maxwell predicted them, so it was not surprising that it took some time for his genius to be appreciated. His Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (1873) is probably the most important physics book between Newton's Principia and those of the twentieth century.

真正保护了Faraday的遗产的是James Clerk Maxwell (1831-79)，新生代的数学物理学家之一。Maxwell与牛顿、爱因斯坦在人们口中味道相同，他是所有时代的物理学家中最有创意的人之一。他生于Edinburgh，在那里上学，然后去了剑桥大学，他回到Scotland教了很短一段时间书，1860年去了伦敦国王学院。在那里的几年是他最有成果的时间。他已经描述过土星的圆环，但在伦敦他发展了一套颜色的理论，并拍了第一张彩照。他一直对电磁现象有兴趣，并将其牢牢的联系在了一起：Maxwell之后，物理学家就可以用数学公式来描述电磁现象了。Maxwell用数学工具和公式描述了Faraday场的概念。他的公式表明，电磁力是一种波，这是整个物理史上最重要的发现之一。这种波以光速传播，现在我们都知道，太阳放射出的光和能量是以电磁波的方式传播的。确实，Maxwell预测了我们所知道的所有波段的波：无线电波使无线电可以广播，厨房里的微波，彩虹的彩色波长范围上下的红外和紫外线光波，还有X射线，γ射线，也都是波。这些波现在已经是我们日常生活的一部分，但在Maxwell预测的时候，大多数都还未发现，所以过了一段时间大家才承认了他的天才。他1873年的专著《电与磁》很可能是牛顿的《基本原理》和20世纪之间最重要的物理著作。

By the time he wrote this book, Maxwell had gone to Cambridge to organize the Cavendish Laboratory, where so much important physics research in the decades to follow would be done. Maxwell himself died young, aged forty-eight, but not before he had carried out fundamental research on how gases behave, using the special mathematical techniques of statistics. This allowed him to describe how the large numbers of atoms in a gas, each moving at slightly different speeds and in different directions, would produce the effects they do at different temperatures and pressures. He provided the mathematical tools to explain what Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke had observed all those years before. Maxwell also developed the basic concept of 'feedback mechanisms': processes that go in loops, which he called 'governors'. These mechanisms are very important in technology, in twentieth-century developments in artificial intelligence, and in computers. They also happen in our own bodies. For instance, when we get too hot, the body senses this and we sweat. The sweat cools our bodies as it evaporates. Or, if we are cold, we shiver, and the contractions of our muscles in the shiver produce heat which warms us. These feedback mechanisms help us maintain a constant body temperature.

Maxwell写这本著作的时候，已经到了剑桥，组织Cavendish实验室，在其后的十多年中，一大批重要物理研究都在这里完成。Maxwell很年轻就去世了，只有48岁，去世前他用特殊的统计数学技术对气体的行为进行了基础研究。这使他可以描述气体中大量的原子，都以略微不同的速度和方向运动，在不同温度和压力下产生什么样的效果。他又提出了一套数学工具，可以对Robert Boyle和Robert Hooke多年前观察到的现象进行解释。Maxwell还提出了“反馈机制”的基本概念：循环进行的过程，他称之为“调节器governor”。这种机制在技术中，在20世纪人工智能的发展中，在计算机中都非常重要。反馈还在我们体内发生，比如，当我们太热的时候，身体就会感受到，然后出汗，汗蒸发的时候使我们的身体凉快；我们冷的时候，会颤抖，颤抖时的肌肉收缩会产生热量，温暖身体。这些反馈机制帮助我们维持身体的恒温。

Maxwell had a gentle sense of humor, was deeply religious and close to his wife, who kept a tight rein on him. At dinner parties, she was prone to say, 'James, you're beginning to enjoy yourself; it is time we go home.' Luckily, she didn't stop his pleasure in the laboratory.

Maxwell非常有幽默感，虔诚的信教，对妻子非常亲近，他的妻子把他管的很紧。在宴会上，她经常会说，“James，你开始不知所以了，该回家了”。幸运的是，她没有阻止他在实验室的乐趣。

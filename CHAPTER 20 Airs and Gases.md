# CHAPTER 20 Airs and Gases
# 第20章 空气和气体

'Air' is a very old word. The word 'gas' is much newer, only a few hundred years old, and the shift from air to gases was crucial. For the ancient Greeks, air was one of the four fundamental elements, just one 'thing'. But Robert Boyle's experiments in the seventeenth century had challenged this view, and scientists had come to realize that the air that surrounds us, and that we all breathe, is made up of more than one substance. From then on it was much easier to understand what was happening in many chemical experiments. Lots of experiments produced something that bubbled up, or went up in a puff and then disappeared into the air. Sometimes the experiment seemed to change the air: chemists often produced ammonia, which made their eyes water, or hydrogen sulphide, which stank of rotten eggs. But without being able to collect the gases in some way, it was hard to know what was going on. Isaac Newton had showed that measurement was important, but it was hard to measure a gas if it was just loose in the atmosphere.

空气是个很古老的词，气体则新的多，，只有几百年的历史，从空气到气体的转变是非常关键的。对于古希腊人来说，空气是四大基本元素之一，只是一种“事物”。但Robert Boyle在17世纪的实验对这个观点提出了挑战，科学家意识到我们周围的空气，我们所有人呼吸的空气，是由两种以上的物质组成的。从那时开始就可以更容易理解很多化学实验中到底发生了什么。很多实验中产生了冒泡的东西，或者喷了一阵烟然后消失在空气中。有时候实验似乎改变了空气：化学家经常生成氨气，会使眼睛流泪，或者硫化氢，闻起来像臭鸡蛋。但没有收集气体的方式，很难搞清楚到底发生了什么。牛顿展示了测量是非常重要的，但如果气体跑到了空气中就很难测量。

So chemists had to find ways to collect pure gases. The most common way of doing this was to conduct the chemical experiment in a small closed space, like a sealed box. This enclosed space was then connected by a tube to an upside-down container completely filled with water. If the gas didn't dissolve in the water - and some gases do - it could bubble up to the top and push the water down. Stephen Hales (1677-1761), an ingenious clergyman, devised a very effective 'water bath' for collecting gases. Hales spent most of his long life as the vicar of Teddington, then a country village, now swallowed up into London. A modest and retiring man, he was also extremely curious and a constant experimenter. Some of his experiments were pretty horrible: he measured the blood pressure in horses, sheep and dogs by directly sticking a hollow tube into an artery. This was attached to a long glass tube, and he simply measured how high the blood rose, which equaled the blood pressure. For a horse, the glass tube had to be nine feet tall (2.7 meters) to prevent the blood spurting out the top.

所以化学家必须找到方法来收集纯气体。最常见的收集气体的方式是在一个小的密闭空间中进行化学实验，比如一个密封的盒子。这个密闭空间与一个充满水的倒置容器通过一个管子相连，如果气体不溶于水（有的气体溶于水），那么就会冒泡到上面，将水挤压下来。Stephen Hales (1677-1761)是一个机智的牧师，设计了一套高效的“水浴”法收集气体。Hales长长的一生中大部分时间都是Teddington的教区牧师，那时候Teddington是一个村子，现在并入了伦敦。他是一个谦虚的退休人员，但他好奇心很强，一直不断的进行着实验。有些实验非常恐怖：他测量马、羊和狗的血压时，会直接把空管子插入动脉，管子与一个长长的玻璃管相连，他就简单的测量血到底能上升到多高，就等于血压。对于一匹马来说，玻璃管必须要到9英尺（2.7米）高，血才能不从顶部喷出来。

Hales also studied the movement of sap in plants and measured the growth of the different parts of plants. He painted tiny specks of ink at regular intervals on their stems and leaves, and then recorded the distances between the specks before and after the plant had grown. He showed that not all the parts grew at the same rate. Hales then used his apparatus for collecting gases to see how plants react in different conditions. He saw that they were using ‘air’, as the atmosphere was still called. (In 1727 his book Vegetable Staticks laid the foundations for the later discovery of photosynthesis, which is how plants use sunlight as a source of energy, and are able to change carbon dioxide and water into sugars and starches, and 'breathe' out oxygen. It is one of the most fundamental processes on our planet. But we are getting ahead of ourselves, and at that stage no one knew about oxygen.)

Hales还对植物体内汁液的运动进行研究，测量植物不同部位的生长。他在植物茎和叶子上点上墨点，然后随着植物的生长记录墨点距离的变化，他展示了记录结果，说明不同部位生长的速度是不一样的。Hales然后用他收集气体的装置观察植物在不同情况下的反应，他发现植物在耗用空气。（在1727年的书《植物静力学》为后世发现光合作用打下基础，也就是植物怎样用阳光作为能源，将二氧化碳与水转化为糖与淀粉，并产生氧气。这是我们这个行星中最基本的过程。但我们讲的有点超前了，因为那时候还没人知道氧气。）

Remember the word pneuma, from Chapter 6? 'Pneumatic' just means ‘relating to air’, and pneumatic chemistry - the chemistry of airs- was one of the most important areas of science in the eighteenth century. (Did you notice that 'airs' was plural there?) Pneumatic chemistry was where it was at from the 1730s onward. It was not just that the older notion of 'air' was giving way to the much more dynamic idea of it actually being made up of several kinds of gases. Scientists were also discovering that most substances can exist as - or be transformed into - a gas, given the right conditions.

还记得第6章中的词“精神pneuma”吗？‘Pneumatic’就只有“与气体相关的”意思，气体化学在18世纪时是科学的重要领域。气体化学开始于18世纪30年代，不是以前“空气”的古老概念简单的让位于更有活力的新想法，也就是空气是由几种气体组成的，科学家还发现大多数物质可以以（或转化成）气体形式存在，只要条件合适。

Stephen Hales had led the way with his water bath, and his demonstration that plants, as well as animals, need air. This 'air' was understood to be a gas that was released when something burned. A Scottish doctor and chemist, Joseph Black (1728-99), collected this 'air' (which he called 'fixed air') and showed that while plants could live in it and use it, animals would die if they were placed in a container with just fixed air to breathe. They needed something else. Black's 'fixed air' is now called carbon dioxide (CO2), and we know it's an essential part of the life cycles of plants and animals. (It is also a ‘greenhouse gas’, a main cause of the 'greenhouse effect', which is leading to global warming.)

Stephen Hales用水浴法引领发展，同时他还证明了植物和动物都需要空气。这个“空气”被理解成燃烧某种东西时释放出的气体。一个苏格兰医生、化学家，Joseph Black (1728-99)，收集了这种“空气”（他称之为“确定空气”），并展示了植物可以在其中存活，并使用这种“空气”，但动物在只包含这种“空气”的容器中则会死掉，它们需要别的东西。Black的“确定空气”现在称为二氧化碳（CO2），我们知道这是动植物生命循环的重要部分（这还是一种温室气体，主要导致温室效应，导致全球变暖）。

A reclusive aristocrat, Henry Cavendish (1731-1810), spent his days in his private laboratory in his London house, experimenting and measuring. He discovered more about fixed air, and collected another air, one that was very light, and exploded when sparked in the presence of ordinary air. He called it ‘inflammable air’. We now call it hydrogen, and it turned out that the explosion produced a clear liquid that was nothing other than water! Cavendish also worked with other gases, such as nitrogen.

一位隐居的贵族，Henry Cavendish (1731-1810)，在伦敦的家里建造了私人实验室，在那里进行实验、测量。他对“确定空气”有了更多发现，并收集到了另一种空气，非常轻，在有正常空气存在时候，点火就会燃烧出火花。他称之为“可燃空气”，我们现在称之为氢气，燃烧爆炸的结果生成的清澈液体就是水，别的什么也没有！Cavendish还对其他气体进行了研究，比如氮气。

No one was as successful in pneumatic chemistry research as Joseph Priestley (1733-1804). Priestley was remarkable. A clergyman, he wrote books on religion, education, politics and the history of electricity. He became a Unitarian, a member of a Protestant group that believed that Jesus was only a very great teacher, not the Son of God. Priestley was also a materialist, teaching that all the things of nature could be explained by the reactions of matter: there was no need for a 'spirit' or 'soul'. During the early days of the French Revolution, which he supported, his house in Birmingham was burned down by people who feared that liberal religious and social views like his might bring revolution across the Channel. He fled to the United States, where he lived the last ten years of his life.

在气体化学的研究中，Joseph Priestley (1733-1804)的工作最为成功。Priestley非常卓越，作为一名牧师，他在宗教、教育、政治以及电的历史方面都有著作。他成为了一个“一位论者”，是新教的一个团体，相信耶稣只是一个伟大的导师，而并不是上帝之子。Priestley还是一位唯物主义者，教授自然界中的所有东西都可以用物质的相互作用来解释：根本不需要“精神”或“灵魂”。在他支持的法国大革命的早期岁月里，他在Birmingham的房子被人们烧毁，因为害怕像他那样的自由的宗教与社会观点会跨越海峡传播过来，导致革命。他逃到美国，在那里度过了生命的最后十年。

Priestley was also a very busy chemist. He used fixed air to make soda water, so remember him the next time you have a fizzy drink. Priestley identified several new gases, and, like all pneumatic chemists, he wondered what happens when things burn. He knew air played a part in burning, and he also knew that there was a kind of 'air' (a gas) that made things burn even more vigorously than the 'ordinary' air that surrounds us. He made this 'air' by heating a substance that we know as mercury oxide, and collecting the gas in a water bath. He showed that animals could live in it, as plants could in fixed air. Priestley's new 'air' was something special: indeed, it seemed to be the principle that was involved in many chemical reactions, as well as in breathing and burning. He thought it could all be accounted for by a substance called ‘phlogiston’, and that all things that can burn contain phlogiston, which is released in the burning process. When the air around becomes saturated with phlogiston, they can no longer burn.

Priestley还是一个非常繁忙的化学家。他用“确定空气”来制作苏打水，所以下次喝泡沫水的时候记得他。Priestley辨认出了几种新气体，就像其他气体化学家一样，想知道当物体燃烧时到底发生了什么。他知道空气在燃烧时起一份作用，他也知道有一种“空气”（气体）比我们周围的普通空气会使物质燃烧的更旺盛。他通过加热一种物质来制作这种“空气”，这种物质就是今天我们知道的氧化汞，并通过水浴法收集这种气体。他展示了动物可以在其中存活，就像植物会在“确定空气”中存活一样。Priestley的新“空气”是很特别的东西：确实，这似乎是与很多化学反应相关的准则，也包括呼吸和燃烧。他认为这都可以用“燃素”这种物质来进行解释，含有燃素的物质就可以燃烧，在燃烧的过程中就会释放燃素。当周围的空气充满了燃素的时候，就不会再燃烧了。

Many chemists used this idea of phlogiston to explain what happens when things burn, and why some 'airs' would make things in a closed container burn for a time, and then seem to make them go out. Burn a lump of lead, and the product (what is left behind) will be heavier than the original lump. This suggested that phlogiston, which scientists thought was contained in the lead and was released through burning, must have a negative weight - that is, it makes whatever contains it lighter than things that don't contain it.

很多科学用燃素的概念来解释物质燃烧时候所发生的事情，以及为什么有的“空气”能使物质在密闭容器中燃烧一会，然后似乎使其熄灭。燃烧一块铅时，其产物（剩余的东西）会比原来那块铅要重。这意味着科学家认为在铅中，燃烧时候释放的燃素，是负质量的，也就是说，包含有这种物质的东西会比不包含的要轻。

When most things burn, the products are gases that are difficult to collect and weigh. Burn a wooden twig, for example, and the product that is easy to see - the ash - is much lighter than the original twig; to get the total weight of the product, the gases given off would have to be collected, weighed and added on.

当大多数事物燃烧时，其产物是气体，很难收集称重。比如燃烧一个小树枝，其产物很容易看到，灰烬，比原来的树枝要轻；要得到所有产物的总重量，必须收集到释放出的气体，对其称重，比加在剩余物的重量中。

In Priestley's scheme, phlogiston took the place of what we call oxygen, except that it had almost exactly the opposite properties! For Priestley, when things burned, they lost phlogiston, and became lighter; but we would say they combine with oxygen, and we now know that things get heavier when this happens. When the candle went out in a closed container, or if a mouse or bird died after a while of being sealed inside a closed container with ordinary air, Priestley said it was because the air was saturated with phlogiston; we now know that it's because the oxygen has been used up. It reminds us that it is possible to do very careful experiments, and take careful measurements, but explain the results in very different ways.

在Priestley的计划中，燃素替代了我们称为氧气的地位，但它含有几乎完全相反的性质！对于Priestley来说，当东西燃烧时，会失去燃素，变轻；但我们会说它们与氧气结合，我们现在知道当这个发生时东西会变重。当蜡烛在密闭容器中熄灭时，或者一只老鼠或小鸟与普通空气密封在容器中时过一段时间会死去，Priestley说是因为空气中充满了燃素；我们现在知道这是因为其中的氧气已经用尽。这提醒我们同样小心的做实验、测量数据，却可以得到非常不同的解释。

The man who named oxygen is still known as the 'father' of modern chemistry. Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743-94) met a violent death during the French Revolution. He was arrested, tried and guillotined, not because he was a chemist, but because he was a ‘tax farmer’. In pre-Revolutionary France, rich men could pay a fee to the State to become tax collectors, and then keep what they could collect. The system was rotten, but there is no evidence that Lavoisier abused it. In fact, he spent a lot of his time before the Revolution doing important scientific and technical research for the State, investigating a number of important questions in manufacturing and agriculture. But he was an aristocrat, and the Revolutionary leaders hated him and his class, and he paid the price. 

命名氧气的人现在仍被称为现代化学之父。Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743-94)在法国大革命中壮烈牺牲，他被捕、受审、上断头台，不是因为他是个化学家，而因为他是个“包税人”。在大革命之前的法国中，富人可以付钱给国家成为收税人，收到的东西全归他们。系统腐败了，但没有证据证明Lavoisier滥用了制度。实际上，大革命前他花了很多时间为国家进行科学技术研究，调查制造业和农业中的几个重要问题。但他是个贵族，大革命的领导人痛恨他以及他的阶层，然后他付出了代价。

Like Priestley, Cavendish and the other pneumatic chemists, Lavoisier was an enthusiastic experimentalist, and was helped by his wife. In fact Madame Lavoisier was an important figure in science. Marie-Anne Pierrette Paultze (1758-1836) married Lavoisier when she was only fourteen years old (he was twenty-eight), and they worked together in the laboratory, performing experiments, taking readings and recording the results. In addition, Madame Lavoisier was a charming hostess. She and her husband entertained learned men and women who discussed the latest developments in science and technology. Theirs was a happy marriage of real partners.

像Priestley、Cavendish和其他气体化学家一样，Lavoisier是一个狂热的实验主义者，他的妻子也帮助了他。实际上Lavoisier夫人是科学界的重要人物。Marie-Anne Pierrette Paultze (1758-1836)在14岁那年就与Lavoisier（28岁）结婚，他们一起在实验室中工作，进行实验、读计数、记录结果。而且，Lavoisier夫人还是个有魅力的家庭主妇。她和她的丈夫会招待那些博学的男女，他们会一起讨论科学与技术的最新进展。他们的婚姻非常幸福，是真正的伙伴。

As a schoolboy, Lavoisier loved science. His sharp mind and scientific ambition were evident from an early age. Like most students who studied chemistry then, he grew up with the phlogiston idea, but he exposed a number of logical and experimental flaws in it. Lavoisier was determined to have the best apparatus available. He and his wife devised new laboratory equipment, always with the aim of improving accuracy in chemical experiments. He used very accurate scales to weigh the substances in his experiments. Several different kinds of experiments convinced him that when things burn, the total weight of all their products increases. This involved collecting and weighing the gases that combustion produced.

从学童时期，Lavoisier就热爱科学，他的敏锐头脑和科学志向从年轻时代就非常明显。和那时候多数学习化学的学生一样，他成长的时候被灌输了燃素的思想，但他提出了其中几个逻辑和实验上的错误。Lavoisier决定要有当时最好的实验设备，他和妻子设计了新的实验室装备，永远致力于改进化学实验的精度。他使用非常精确的天平在实验中给物质称重。几个不同种类的实验使他相信，当物质燃烧时，总重量是增加的，这包括了收集燃烧产生的气体并称重。

Lavoisier also continued to investigate what happens when we (and other animals) breathe. These experiments assured him that the substance involved in both combustion and respiration was a single, real element, and not some kind of substance like phlogiston. This element also seemed to be necessary for acids to form. The chemical reactions of acids and alkalis (the latter are sometimes called ‘bases’) had long fascinated chemists. Remember Robert Boyle's invention of litmus paper? Lavoisier continued this line of work. Indeed, he believed that oxygen (which means 'acid former') is so important in acids that they always contain that element. We now know that this is not true (hydrochloric acid, one of the most powerful acids, contains hydrogen and chlorine, but no oxygen). Yet much of what Lavoisier said about oxygen is still part of our knowledge today. We now know it is the element needed for things to burn, or for us to breathe, and that those two seemingly different processes have much in common. Humans use oxygen to 'burn', or process, sugars and other things we eat, to give our bodies energy to carry out our daily functions.

Lavoisier继续研究当我们（和其他动物）呼吸时发生了什么。这些实验使他确信燃烧和呼吸涉及的物质是一种单一的、真实的元素，而不是像燃素那样的物质。这种元素在酸的形成中似乎也是必须的。酸与碱（后面有时候会称为‘bases’）的化学反应很长时间以来都使化学家着迷。记得Robert Boyle发明的石蕊试纸吗？Lavoisier沿着这条线继续工作。确实，他相信氧气（英文意思是“酸形成者”）在酸中非常重要，每种酸都有这种物质。我们现在知道这并不正确（盐酸，HCl，最强的酸之一，包含氢和氯，没有氧）。但Lavoisier对氧气的大部分说法今天仍然是我们的知识的一部分。我们现在知道这是物质燃烧需要的元素，或者是我们呼吸的元素，这两种看起来不同的过程有很多共同点。人类用氧气来“燃烧”，或处理，糖和我们吃的其他东西，给我们的身体供给能量，进行日常活动。

Lavoisier and his wife continued with their chemical experiments during the 1780s, and in 1789, just on the eve of the French Revolution, Lavoisier published his most famous book. Its English title is Elements of Chemistry, and it is just that. It is the first modern textbook of the subject, full of information on experiments and equipment, and containing his reflections on the nature of the chemical element. We now call an element some substance that cannot be broken down any further by chemical experiments. A compound is a combination of elements which, given the right experiment, can be broken down. So water is a compound, made up of two elements, hydrogen and oxygen. This distinction was at the heart of Lavoisier's important book. His list of elements, or 'simple substances', did not contain all the elements chemists now recognize, as many had not yet been discovered. It did include surprising things such as light and heat. But Lavoisier laid down the basic framework for understanding the difference between an element and a compound.

Lavoisier和他的妻子在18世纪80年代继续进行他们的化学实验，在1789年，法国大革命前夜，Lavoisier出版了他最为著名的著作，《化学基本论述》(Elements of Chemistry)。这是第一部现代化学教科书，满满的都是实验和仪器信息，还包含了他对化学元素性质的思考。我们现在所说的元素是不能被化学实验所分解的物质。化合物是元素的组合，在适当的实验中可以被分解。所以水是一种化学物，由氢和氧两种元素组成。这种区别是Lavoisier这部重要著作的核心。他的元素列表，或叫“简单物质”，并没包括现在科学家发现的所有元素，因为很多还没有被发现，还包括一些让人吃惊的东西比如光和热。但Lavoisier为理解元素和化合物的区别形成了基本框架。

Just as important was his belief that the language of chemistry must be precise. With several colleagues, Lavoisier reformed the language of his subject, demonstrating that to do good science, you needed to be precise in the words you use. (Linnaeus would have agreed.) Chemists needed to be able to refer to the compounds and elements they were experimenting with, so that any other chemist, anywhere in the world, would know they were dealing with exactly the same things. He wrote, ‘We think only through the medium of words’. After Lavoisier, chemists increasingly shared a common language.

一样重要的是，他坚信化学语言必须精确。和几个同事一起，Lavoisier改革了化学语言，证明了为了做好的科学工作，必须用语精确（Linnaeus肯定会同意）。化学家需要能够在谈到实验用的化合物和元素时，其他任何化学家，不管在世界哪里，都能知道他们说的是同一个东西。他写到，“我们只能通过单词这个媒介来思考”。在Lavoisier之后，越来越多的化学家都适用同一种语言。

# CHAPTER 28 Engines and Energy
# 第28章 引擎和能量

‘I sell here, Sir, what all the world desires to have – POWER’. The engineer Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) knew what he was talking about. In the 1770s Boulton and other ambitious men, such as the inventor James Watt (1736-1819), were using steam engines in mining and manufacturing. They seemed to have tamed energy, or power. These men drove forward the Industrial Revolution in Britain, the first country to industrialize and to develop the factory system. It was a revolution driven by scientific advances, and relied on huge increases in power to manufacture goods at great speed and transport them far and wide. Our modern world is unimaginable without energy - lots of it. And it all started with steam.

“我在这卖全世界都渴望的东西：能量”。工程师Matthew Boulton（1728-1809）知道自己在说什么。18世纪70年代Boulton和其他野心勃勃的人，像发明家James Watt（1736-1819），用蒸汽引擎来采矿和工业制造，他们好像有驯化的能量。这些人驱动了英国的工业革命，工业化和发展工厂系统的第一个世纪。这是一次科学驱动的革命，依靠能量的巨大进步来快速生产货物，并运输到又远又广泛的地方去。我们现代世界没有了巨大的能量是无法想象的，这都是从蒸汽开始的。

Steam engines themselves are pretty simple. You can see the principle in action every time you boil a pan of water with a lid on: the force of the steam presses up on the lid to let the steam out and makes it rattle. Now imagine instead of a pan you have a closed cylinder with just a small hole in one end of it. Into this is fitted a moveable piston (that is, a disk that fits snugly into the cylinder, with a knob that fits snugly into the hole). The pressure of the escaping steam will force the piston up and move whatever might be attached to it: perhaps a rod with the wheels of a train attached to it. So a steam engine changes the energy of the steam into movement: mechanical energy. This engine can do useful work, such as driving a piece of machinery or pumping lots of water out of a mine.

蒸汽机本身是非常简单的。每次你用一个带盖子的壶烧水的时候都可以看到其原理：蒸汽的力量把盖子顶开，让蒸汽冒出，发出各种声音。现在想象一下，不是一个壶，而是一个封闭的圆筒（汽缸），在一端有一个小孔。圆筒中装入了一个活塞（圆筒中紧密的装入了一个圆盘，小洞中紧密的装入了一个把手）。蒸汽宣泄的力量会使活塞向上运动，移动连在上面的任何东西：可能是火车轮子上连着的棒子。所以蒸汽机可以将能量变成运动：机械能。这种引擎可以做很多有用的工作，比如驱动一个机械或将矿井下大量的水抽出来。

Neither Boulton nor Watt invented the steam engine: they had been around for more than a hundred years. But the early models were crude, unreliable and inefficient. Watt, in particular, was the brain behind the improvement of the engine. His model not only provided the power that helped Britain industrialize, it also led scientists to investigate a basic law of nature. It helped them see that heat was not a substance, as Lavoisier had thought, but a form of energy.

Boulton和Watt都没有发明蒸汽机，蒸汽机已经存在了一百多年了。但早期的模型是非常粗糙、不可靠、效率低下。而瓦特则改进了蒸汽机，他的模型不仅提供了使英国工业化的动力，还引领科学家研究其基本性质定律。它帮助了人们看清热不是Lavoisier所说的一种物质，而是一种能量的形式。

Among the thoughtful people who were studying engines during the Industrial Revolution, one man in particular stands out from the crowd. This was a young French engineer, Sadi Carnot (1796-1832). The French and the British were great rivals at this time. Carnot was aware that the British had forged ahead in designing steam engines and using the power that they generated. He wanted France to catch up, and while watching steam engines do their work, he discovered a fundamental scientific principle. He was concerned with a steam engine's efficiency.

当工业革命时代的人们都在沉思研究引擎时，有一个人则没有那么做。这是一个法国工程师，Sadi Carnot（1796-1832）。法国和英国当时是激烈的竞争对手。Carnot很清楚英国在设计蒸汽机、使用其能量方面走在了前面。他希望法国追赶上，当观察蒸汽机工作时，他发现了一个基本的科学原理。他当时在关注蒸汽机的效率。

If a steam engine is perfectly efficient, it will turn to power all the energy needed to boil the water to drive the engine. You can measure the amount of heat produced by burning coal or wood to create the steam, then measure the power, or work the piston generated. If the engine were absolutely efficient, they would be exactly the same. Alas, absolutely efficient engines are impossible to build.

如果一个蒸汽机是全效的话，它将会把所有煮沸水的能量都用来驱动引擎。可以测量出燃烧煤或木头产生蒸汽的能量，再测量活塞产生的能量或做的功。如果引擎效率100%，那么这两个能量应当相等。但绝对100%效率的引擎是不可能制造出来的。

All engines have what is called a heat sump, or 'sink', where the cooled steam and water collect after doing their work. You can measure the temperature of the steam going in and the temperature of the steam (or water) that is left at the end of each cycle. In the sump, the temperature is always lower coming out than it was going in. Carnot showed that you could use the difference between the two temperatures to calculate the efficiency of an engine. If perfect efficiency would score 1, then the actual efficiency is 1 minus the temperature in the sink (going out) divided by the temperature in the source (coming in). The only way to score the 1 of perfect efficiency would be to have the engine extracting all the heat out of the steam. Then, the ratio between out and in would be zero. That would give 1-0=1. For that to happen, one of the temperature measurements would have to be either zero or infinity: infinitely hot steam coming in or 'absolute zero' (the lowest temperature theoretically possible, which we will look at below) going out to the sink. Neither is possible, so efficiency is always less than perfect.

所有引擎都有热集水槽，或者就叫水槽，这是收做工后集冷却的蒸汽和水的地方。可以在每个循环的最后测量进入蒸汽机的蒸汽的温度和出来的蒸汽（或水）的温度。在集水槽中，出来的温度永远要比进入的温度要低，Carnot表示可以使用两者的温度差来表示引擎的工作效率。如果完美的工作效率是100%的话，那么实际的工作效率就是100%减去水槽中的温度除以源头的温度。达到100%效率的唯一方法就是引擎获取了蒸汽中的所有热量。那时，出入温度比将为0，这将得到100%-0=100%。如果这种情况发生，那么其中一个温度计量应当是0或无穷大：无穷热的蒸汽进入，或绝对零度（理论上所能达到的最低温度，下面我们将会看到）的输出到达水槽。两者都不可能，所以效率总是没有完美的。

Carnot's simple equation, aimed at measuring the efficiency of engines, also summarizes a deep law of nature. It explains why 'perpetual motion' machines are sometimes written about in science fiction, but can never exist in the real world. We always have to use energy to produce energy - for instance, we have to burn coal or some other fuel to heat the water in the first place. In the 1840s and 1850s, other scientists were working on this basic fact of nature. One of them was a German physicist, Rudolph Clausius (1822-88), who spent much of his life looking at how heat flows in carefully controlled experimental situations. To do this, he introduced a new concept in physics: entropy. Entropy is a measure of how mixed up (disordered) the things in a system are. It is much easier to mix things up than to unmix them. If you mix white with black paint, you get grey paint. The mixing is easy, but it's impossible to unmix them and get the pure black and white paints back again. If you stir milk and sugar in your tea, you can recover the sugar if you take a lot of trouble, but getting the milk back is impossible. Energy is no different: once you burn the coal, you can't use the heat it produced to get your coal back.

Carnot的简单公式目的是测量引擎的效率，同时也总结了自然的深奥定律。这解释了科幻小说中有时出现的永动机在现实世界是不可能的。我们永远只能用能量产生能量，比如，首先我们要燃烧煤或其他燃料来对水进行加热。在19世纪40年代和50年代，其他科学家在这个自然的基本情况上进行工作。其中一个是德国物理学家，Rudolph Clausius（1822-88），他一生的大部分时间都在观察在受控的实验环境中热量是如何流动的。他引入了一个新的物理概念 - 熵 - 来做这项工作。熵是描述一个系统无序程度的度量。把东西混在一起比分开这些混合物要容易。如果将白色颜料和黑色颜料混合在一起，将会得到灰色颜料；混合起来很容易，但分解灰色颜料再次得到纯白色和纯黑色颜料是不可能的。如果在茶中搅拌入牛奶和糖，可以费点劲把糖分离出来，但牛奶是不可能分离出来的。能量也是一样的，一旦燃烧了煤得到热量，就不可能用热量重新生产出煤。

For people in the nineteenth century, entropy was a depressing idea. Clausius declared that the universe is becoming more and more mixed up, because entropy is its 'natural' stage. Once things get mixed up, it takes more energy to unmix them, just as it takes more energy to clean up a room than to get it messy. According to Clausius, the universe is slowly running down, and the end point will be a universe in which matter and energy are evenly distributed through all space. Even our sun will eventually die, in about five billion years, and with it, life on earth. In the meantime, of course, plants and animals, and human beings and our houses and computers, defy the ultimate endpoint of Clausius's insight. As the old saying has it, ‘make hay while the sun shines’.

对于19世纪的人来说，熵是个令人沮丧的概念。Claudius声称宇宙的混合程度越来越高，因为熵是其自然阶段。一旦东西混合起来后，需要更多的熵来分离他们，就像把房间弄乱很容易，但需要更多的能量来整理房间一样。根据Clausius，宇宙是逐渐走下坡路的，最终宇宙到处都将分布着物质和能量。即使太阳在大约50亿年后最终也会消亡， 然后地球上的生命也会灭亡。当然同时，动植物，人类，我们的房子和计算机都在挑战Clausius最终点的见解。就像有句古老的谚语所说的，“晒草要趁太阳好”。

While physicists and engineers were worrying about the effects of entropy, they were also looking at what, exactly, energy was. Heat is an important form of energy, so the study of energy is called thermodynamics (a word that combines the Greek words for 'heat' and 'power'). In the 1840s several people came to similar conclusions about the relationships between different forms of energy. They were looking at a variety of things. What happens when water freezes or boils? How are our muscles able to lift weights? How do steam engines manage to use the hot water vapor to produce something that can do work? (The first public railway, driven by steam engines, had opened in the north of England in 1825.) Coming to the question from these different angles, they all realized that you cannot create energy out of nothing, nor can you make it completely disappear. All you can do with energy is to make it change from one form to another. Sometimes you can make this change do some work for you along the way. This became known as the principle of conservation of energy.

当物理学家和工程师担心熵会导致的结果时，他们也在研究能量到底是什么。热是能量的一种重要形式，所以有关能量的研究被称为热力学（希腊词语热和能的结合）。在19世纪40年代有关能量的不同形式之间的关系，有几个人得到了类似的结论。他们当时正在观察很多事物，当水结冰或沸腾的时候发生了什么？我们的肌肉为什么能够提起重物？蒸汽机为什么能用热水蒸汽产生能做这些工作的东西？（第一条蒸汽机驱动的铁路1825年在英国北部开通）。从不同的角度看待这个问题时，他们都意识到不能凭空产生能量，也不能让其完全消失。你只能将能量从一种形式转化为另一种形式，有时候你可以利用这种转换顺便做点工作。人们逐渐知道了这就是能量转换定律。

The Manchester physicist J.P. Joule (1818-89) wanted to understand the relationship between heat and work. How much energy does it take to do a certain amount of work? In a series of brilliant experiments, he showed that heat and work are directly related in ways that can be expressed mathematically. You use energy to produce work (to ride a bicycle, for instance), and heat is a common form of energy. Think about climbing to the top of a mountain. We use energy every time we move our muscles. This comes from the food that we eat and digest, using the oxygen we breathe to 'burn' the calories in our food. Now, there may be two paths to the mountain top, one very steep, and the other more gradual. What Joule showed is that, in terms of the energy needed, it doesn't matter which path you take. The steep path might leave you with aching muscles, but the amount of energy that you use in moving the weight of your body from the bottom to the top is the same, whichever path you take, or whether you run or walk up. Physicists still remember Joule's name. It is attached to several measurements, including a unit of energy, or heat.

曼彻斯特物理学家J.P. Joule（1818-89）想了解热能和做功之间的关系，需要消耗多少能量才做一定数量的功呢？在一系列精彩的实验中，他展示了热和功是直接联系的，而且可以用数学公式表达出来。可以用热做功（比如骑一辆自行车），热是能量的一种常见形式。想想爬到山顶的情形。每次我们肌肉运动，我们都使用能量，能量从我们吃了然后消化的食物中来，用吸入的氧气燃烧食物中的卡路里。现在，可能有两条路到山顶，一条非常陡峭，一条平缓很多，Joule展示的是，不管走那条路，所需的能量都是一样的。陡峭的那条路可能会使你肌肉酸疼，但你将身体运动到山顶所需的能量是一样的，不论走那条路，不论是走或跑。物理学家仍然铭记Joule的名字，几种测量单位都在使用，包括能量或热量的单位。

People have long tried to measure how much heat an object contains, that is, its temperature. Galileo (Chapter 12) played around with a ‘thermoscope’, an instrument that changed as the temperature increased. A thermoscope allowed you to see that things were getting hotter or colder; a thermometer allowed you to put a number on the degree of heat. We still use two early attempts at devising a scale of temperatures. One was invented by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686-1736), who used thermometers containing both mercury and alcohol; in his scale, water freezes at 32 degrees, and our normal body temperature is 96 degrees. Anders Celsius (1701-44) devised his scale using the freezing and boiling points of water, with the former being set at zero degrees, and the latter at 100 degrees. His thermometer measured temperatures between these two points. These two scales are still part of our daily lives, from knowing what temperature to bake a cake at, to complaining about the weather.

人们一直想测量一个物体含有多少热量，也就是它的温度。Galileo（第12章）发明了一种测温器，一种随着温度变化而变化的仪器。测温器让人可以看到物体是变热了还是变凉了，温度计使人可以看到热度的具体数量。我们仍然在使用早期设计的温度计量单位。一种是德国物理学家Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit（1686-1736）发明的，他使用的温度计包含汞和酒精，在他的度量里，水在32度结冰，我们身体的正常温度是96度。Anders Celsius（1701-44）设计了一种度量，使水在0度时结冰，在100度时沸腾。他的温度计测量这两个点范围内的温度。这两种度量仍然是现代日常生活的一部分，可以用在确定烘焙蛋糕时需要的温度，和抱怨天气的时候。

The Scottish physicist William Thomson (1824-1907) invented another scale. He was especially interested in how heat and other forms of energy work in nature. He was a professor at the University of Glasgow and was later given the title Lord Kelvin. His temperature scale is known as the Kelvin or K scale. He worked out the K scale using very precise measurements and scientific principles. Compared with the K scale, Celsius and Fahrenheit turn out to be crude measures of temperature.

苏格兰物理学家William Thomson（1824-1907）发明了另一种度量。他对热和其他形式的能量在自然中是如何做工的很感兴趣。他是Glasgow大学的教授，后面还授予了Lord Kelvin的头衔。他的温度度量就是Kelvin或K度量。他用了非常精密的测量和科学的原则来确定了K度量。与K度量相比，Celsius和Fahrenheit都是温度的粗糙度量。

The K scale's defining point is the ‘triple point of water’. This occurs when the three states of water- ice (a solid), water (a liquid) and water vapor (a gas) - are in 'thermodynamic equilibrium'. Thermodynamic equilibrium can happen in an experimental system, when a substance is insulated from its surroundings so that temperature and pressure are fixed. Then there is no change in the state of a substance and no energy escapes or enters the system. The triple point of water is when its solid, liquid and gas are held in perfect balance. As soon as the temperature or pressure changes then the balance or equilibrium is lost.

K度量的基准点是水的三相点。这是水在三种状态，固态，液态和气态处于热力学平衡时的温度。热力学平衡在实验状态下达到，当物质与周围环境隔热，这样温度和压强都是固定的状态，物质与环境没有物质或能量的交换。水的三相点是当固液气三态达到完美平衡时的点。当温度或压强变化时，平衡就会被打破。

In Celsius and Fahrenheit, temperatures go into minus when it's very cold. You will have heard weather forecasters say ‘minus two or three degrees’. There are no negative numbers in the K scale. Water freezes at 273.16 degrees Kelvin (as compared with 0 degrees in the Celsius scale and 32 degrees in the Fahrenheit scale). It gets a lot colder on the way down to 0 degrees Kelvin. But here 0 really means 0 or 'absolute zero'. At this impossibly cold temperature, all motion, all energy, stops. Just like the perfectly efficient engine, we cannot quite get there.

在Celsius和Fahrenheit度量中，温度非常低的时候就会达到负值。你肯定听到过天气预报员说过“零下2度或3度”。在K度量中没有负值的温度，水在K氏273.16度时结冰（Celsius为0度，Fahrenheit为32度），如果到了K氏0度，那就非常非常冷了，这里0度的意思是真的0度，或绝对零度。在这种不可能达到的低温中，所有的运动和能量都停止了。就像100%效率的引擎一样，我们无法达到这种温度。

Kelvin and others helped to explain both the science and the practical workings of all kinds of engines. As the nineteenth century progressed, the three discoveries outlined in this chapter became the first, second and third law of thermodynamics: the conservation of energy, the 'law' of entropy, and the absolute stillness of atoms at absolute zero. These laws help us understand important things about energy, work and power.

Kelvin和其他人帮助解释了各种引擎的科学上和实际工作中的原理。当19世纪过去，本章所描述的三个发现成为了热力学第一、第二和第三定律：能量守恒定律，熵的定律和原子在绝对零度的绝对静止。这些定律帮助我们理解了能量、功和功率的重要方面。

The modern world could not get enough of its new-found power: to run factories, ships, trains and - towards the end of Kelvin's life - motor cars. Trains and steam ships used the heat from coal in their furnaces to produce steam to drive the engines. But cars depended on a new kind of engine: the internal combustion engine. This needed a highly volatile fuel called petrol, or gasoline, which was discovered near the end of the nineteenth century. Petrol would become one of the most important products of the next century. Now, in the new millennium, it is still one of the most fought over and increasingly scarce resources in the world.

现代世界从新发现的力量中得到了太多东西：开设工厂，开动轮船、火车，在Kelvin最后的日子里，机车也开动了。火车和蒸汽轮船用熔炉中燃烧的煤产生蒸汽来驱动引擎，但汽车依靠一种新引擎：内燃机，这需要一种很不稳定的燃料，叫做汽油，这是19世纪的最后的发现。汽油将成为下个世纪最重要的产品之一。现在，在新的千年中，这仍然是世界上争夺最激烈的、也是越来越稀有的资源。

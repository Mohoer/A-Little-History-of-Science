# CHAPTER 33 Moving Continents
# 第33章 活动的大陆

Earthquakes are deadly and terrifying. Deadly because of the wholesale destruction they cause, terrifying because the earth should not move beneath our feet. And yet it does, all the time, if mostly unseen and unfelt. Like so much of science, understanding the earth's structure is about measuring the unseen, unfelt part - and convincing others that you're right. The continents and ocean f1oors do move beneath us.

地震是非常致命和恐怖的，致命是因为会造成大规模的破坏，恐怖是因为我们脚下的大地不应该移动。但实际上大地一直在移动，主要是我们看不到也感觉不到这种移动。就像大多数科学一样，理解地球的结构是在测量那些看不到、感觉不到的部分中进行的，然后让别人相信你是对的。我们下面的大陆和海底确实在移动。

What we experience of the earth's history in our lives is a tiny snapshot, the smallest of moments in a very long process. Geologists have scientific techniques, but they must also use their imaginations, thinking 'outside the box'. All good scientists do, even if they are working in the laboratory, checking their ideas against the evidence at hand.

我们生命中正在经历的地球的历史就像是一个快照，只不过是地球漫长历史中一个极短的瞬间。虽然地质学家有科学技术，但他们还是主要运用想象力“在盒子之外”思考。所有优秀科学家都将思想与手头的证据相对质，即使他们正在实验室中工作。

Our nineteenth-century geologists used the traditional tools: fossil finds, analyzing and classifying rocks, looking at the effects of earthquakes and volcanoes. All this they wove into a reasonable history of the earth. Much of what they learned still holds true today. But there were a number of problems that nagged at them, and needed a new kind of bold idea. The old 'catastrophists' had relied on the idea of different sorts of forces, or perhaps even miraculous interventions - great floods such as Noah's Flood described in the Bible. Instead, the new focus would be on time - immense periods of time called ‘deep time’. What was the earth like, 200 million years ago, or twice or three times that number of years ago?

我们19世纪的地质学家使用的是传统的工具：化石发现，岩石分析和分类，观察地震和火山。通过这些他们编织了地球合理的历史。他们发现的知识在今天大部分仍然正确，但有几个问题一直困扰着他们，这需要一些新的大胆的想法。老的“灾变说”依靠几种不同的作用力的思想，甚至依靠不可思议的创造，比如圣经中所说的诺亚大洪水。新的科学焦点放在了时间上，漫长的时间段，称之为“深时”。地球在2亿年前，或者4亿、6亿年前是什么样子的？

How could deep time help answer three key questions? First, why did the major continents look as if they could be cut out from the oceans and stuck together, like pieces in an enormous jigsaw puzzle? The east coast of South America would fit pretty snugly into the west coast of Africa. Was this an accident?

深时怎么回答这三个问题呢？第一，为什么主要的大陆看起来好像被海洋切割开来，如果拼接起来就像一个巨大的拼图游戏？南美东海岸与非洲西海岸可以非常完美的拼接起来，这是巧合吗？

Second, why were the rock formations of South Africa so like ones found in Brazil, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean? Why, in such a small island as Great Britain, were there dramatic variations between the Highlands of Scotland, with its crags and lochs, and the gently rolling Weald of Sussex in the south? Indeed, had Britain always been separated from the European mainland? Or Alaska from Asia?

第二，南非的地质结构与大西洋彼岸巴西发现的为什么这么像？为什么在英国这么狭小的岛屿上会有这么大的地质结构差异，苏格兰高原上的峭壁和海湾，南方Sussex郡Weald地区的缓变的形态？英国一直都在欧洲大陆分隔之外么？还有阿拉斯加和亚洲的关系？

Third, there were some odd patterns in the locations of plants and animals. Why were some species of snail found both in Europe and in eastern North America, but not on the other side of the American continent, on the west? Why were the marsupials in Australia so different from those found elsewhere? In the 1850s Darwin and Wallace pioneered some answers, and the theory of evolution helped explain a lot. Darwin ran some very smelly experiments, keeping seeds sitting in tubs of seawater in his study for months on end. He wanted to give the seeds an experience like a long sea journey. Then he planted them to see if they could germinate and grow. Sometimes they did, so that was one answer. Darwin also found ways to discover if birds could transport seeds, insects and other living things over very long distances. And they could, but this didn't explain all the puzzles.

第三，在植物动物的分布方面有些奇怪的模式。为什么在欧洲和北美洲东部都发现了一些同样的腹足纲动物，但北美洲大陆的另一边，即西部却没有？为什么澳大利亚的有袋类动物和其他地方发现的如此不同？在19世纪50年代达尔文和Wallace最先找到一些回答，进化论解释了很多问题。达尔文做了一些smelly实验，把种子放进装满海水的桶里几个月。他想模拟种子长途渡海的经历，看看这些种子是不是能发芽然后长大。有时候确实可以，所以这是一个答案。达尔文同时还尝试实验鸟，昆虫，或者其他生物是不是能长途携带种子，它们确实可以，但这并不能解释所有问题。

There was one radical idea that could explain a great deal. This theory was that the continents had not always been where they are now, or that they had once been joined by strips of land, ‘land bridges’. Many geologists from the late nineteenth century thought that there had once been land bridges in several places. There was good evidence that Britain had once been connected to Europe. It would explain very effectively why the fossil bones of bears, hyenas and other animals, not found in Britain in modern times, were found there. North America had once been connected to Asia across the Bering Strait, with animals and Native Americans undoubtedly crossing there. Land bridges joining Africa and South America seemed less likely, but the eminent Austrian geologist Eduard Suess (1831-1914) had a go at arguing this in his massive five-volume work (published between 1883 and 1909) on the earth. He said that the constant rising and falling of the surfaces of the earth during geological history made this possible. What was now sea-bed had once connected the two continents.

有一种很激进的思想可以解释很多问题。这个理论就是大陆并不一直是静止不动的，或者是有些大陆曾经被陆地带所连接，即“陆地桥”。许多19世纪晚期的地质学家认为在几个地方曾经有过陆地桥。有很多证据证明英国曾经与欧洲大陆是连在一起的。这可以很好的解释为什么现代英国没有熊、鬣狗和其他一些动物，但却有它们的化石。北美洲与亚洲曾经由白令海峡连在一起过，动物和美洲土著人曾经毫无疑问的穿过那里。非洲与南美洲的陆地桥似乎不太可能存在，但著名的奥地利地质学家Eduard Suess（1831-1914）在他有关地球的5卷巨著（1883-1909年出版）中试图辩论这个问题，他说地质史上地球表面持续的升降使这是可能的，现在是海床的地方曾经连接过两个大陆。

Not everyone was convinced, five volumes or not. Enter the German Alfred Wegener (1880-1930). Wegener was equally interested in the history of the earth's weather and its geology. In 1912 he gave a lecture on his theory of the continents moving: what would become ‘continental drift’. The lecture became a book in 1915, and Wegener spent the rest of his life looking for further evidence. He died on the job, leading an expedition to Greenland to search for more clues to support his theory. Wegener's radical proposal was that, around 200 million years ago, there was only one large continent, Pangaea, surrounded by a vast ocean. This enormous continent had gradually broken up, with pieces of it literally floating on the ocean, like icebergs breaking away and floating on the sea. Unlike icebergs, which can melt and fade, the pieces of Pangaea became the new continents. And it wasn't over. Wegener thought the land masses were still moving apart, about ten meters a year. This estimate was way too high - recent measurements suggest a movement of only a few millimeters each year. But anything over a long enough period produces dramatic results.

尽管是5卷巨著，但这并没有说服所有人。然后进入了德国人Alfred Wegener（1880-1930）的时代，Wegener同样非常感兴趣地球天气和地质情况的历史。1912年他就其大陆移动的理论进行了授课，后来成为“大陆漂移学说”。授课内容在1915年成书，Wegener的余生都在寻找更多的证据，并在这份工作中去世，最后的时候他带人去格陵兰岛探险，寻找线索支持其理论。Wegener的激进理论声称，大约2亿年前，地球上只有一片大陆，称为Pangaea，被茫茫大海所包围。这个巨大的大陆逐渐分裂，多块大陆在海上漂浮，就像冰山裂开漂浮在海上一样。冰山最终会融化消失，Pangaea的裂片最终形成了新的几块大陆。这并没有结束。Wegener认为现在的陆地群仍然在运动分开之中，以大约每年10米的速度。这个估计速度太高了，现在测量结果认为每年大约移动几毫米。但再小的速度只要时间足够长就能产生可观的结果。

Wegener had a few supporters, mainly in his native Germany, but most geologists found his ideas too far-fetched - too much like science fiction. Then, during the Second World War, submarines began the serious exploration of the ocean floor. After the war they revealed a new underwater landscape with enormous ridges of mountains and valleys, and extinct (and even active) volcanoes. Harry Hess (1906-69), a geologist working for the US Navy, traced these ridges and valleys and followed them on to the better-known dry land. He also followed the fault lines, those regions of the earth above and below water where earthquakes and volcanoes are common. What Hess discovered was that the land masses and the ocean floor were continuous, they ran into each other. The land didn't float as Wegener had suggested. How then might land masses move?

Wegener有几个支持者，主要在德国国内，但多数地质学家还是认为他的观点非常勉强，很像科幻小说。接着在二战时，潜艇开始了认真的海底大陆探测。战后他们展示了新的水下风景，有巨大的山脉和山谷，熄灭的甚至活跃的火山。Harry Hess（1906-69）是一个在美国海军工作的地质学家，查探追踪这些海底山脉和山谷，然后一直跟踪到了dry land。他还跟踪了断层线，也就是地震和火山爆发频繁的地上和水下地区。Hess发现大陆和海底是连续的，它们互相碰撞到了一起。大陆并不是像Wegener说的那样漂移。那么大陆到底是怎样运动的呢？

Hess was joined by physicists, meteorologists (weather watchers), oceanographers (studiers of the sea), seismologists (specialists in earthquakes) and the traditional geologists. They all began to try to work out the history of our earth, using the tools of these different sciences. This was not easy. The interior of the earth quickly gets very hot. Not that far down, instruments melt. So a lot of what we know about the composition and structure of our world's inner reaches had to be learned by indirect methods. Science is often like that.

Hess和一些物理学家，气象学家，海洋学家，地震学家，地质学家一起，他们开始共同研究我们的地球的历史，运用不同科学提供的工具。这并不容易，地球内部迅速变得非常高温，仪器没有到地下多深就融化了，所以关于地球内部的构造和组成需要借助间接手段研究，科学通常就是这样的。

Volcanoes spewing their molten lava had long been interpreted as the earth getting rid of the excess heat that had accumulated below, and in one sense, this is true. But it's not the whole picture. The discovery that radioactive elements, such as uranium, naturally release a lot of energy when they decay, added another source of interior heat. But radioactivity is an ongoing heat-producing source, and this meant that the older idea that the earth had once been a very hot ball but was now gradually cooling, was too simple.

火山喷出岩浆通常被解释为地球释放积累的热量，这在某种意义上也是正确的，但这并不是所有的解释。放射性元素如铀衰退的时候自然就会释放大量能量，这为地球内部热量增加了一个来源。但放射是一个不断进行的热源，所以以前解释地球是一个非常热的球，现在逐渐冷却，这太简单了。

At least, it was too simple for the geologist Arthur Holmes(1890-1965). He said that the earth gets rid of most of its continuously generated internal heat by the familiar process of heat transfer, convection. The important bit was Holmes's realization that it wasn't in the earth's upper crust - where we live - that things were happening, but in the next layer down towards the centre of the earth. This layer is called the mantle, and Holmes believed that the molten rocks there gradually move upwards, like the hotter water in your bath. As they move up and away from the hotter area, they cool, and sink down again, to be replaced by other molten rock, in a timeless cycle. It is some of this molten rock on the rise that spews out when volcanoes erupt. Most molten rock never makes it to the earth's surface, but spreads out as it cools and sinks, providing a mechanism to shift the continents apart, millimeter by millimeter.

至少这对于地质学家Arthur Holmes（1890-1965）来说太过简单了，他说地球释放持续产生的热量的方法是常见的热传导方式，对流。Holmes意识到重要的地方不在于地球上部的外壳发生了什么，而在向着地心的下面一层。这一层叫做地幔，Holmes相信在那里熔化的岩石逐渐向上运动，就像沐浴时的热水一样，当熔岩向上运动并远离了高温区域后，熔岩冷却并再次下沉，被其他熔岩取代，这个循环一直进行下去。有的熔岩向上运动并喷发出来，形成了火山爆发。绝大多数熔岩从未到达地球表面，而是随着冷却下沉扩散开来，这也为大陆一毫米一毫米的漂移提供了一种机制。

As the depths of the oceans and earth were explored, a new way of working out the age of the planet added real meaning to deep time. The technique of radiometric dating had emerged from physicists' discovery of radioactivity (Chapter 31). Now it allowed the scientists to date the rocks they were studying by comparing the amounts of a radioactive element and its end product (uranium and lead, for example) in a rock sample. Using this technique, it was possible to know how old the rocks were, since after they are formed, no new material is incorporated in to them. Knowing the age of individual rock layers has in turn helped understand just how old the earth is. Rocks of more than four billion years have been found. Such old rocks are always on land. Those at the bottom of oceans are always newer. Oceans don't last as long as continents, and are in fact always dying and being reborn. This of course happens over a very long period of time, so don't worry about next summer at the beach. (On the other hand, man-made global warming may well keep melting the polar icecaps and lead to a dangerous rise in sea-levels in the coming decades.)

随着海洋和地球深处的探测，出现了新的计算地球年龄的方法。物理学家对放射能力的发现（见第31章）形成了放射性定年法的技术。现在科学家可以通过比较岩石样品中的放射性元素和最终产物（如铀和铅）的含量来确定岩石的年龄。采用这种技术，就很可能知道岩石的年龄，因为它们形成之后，就没有新的物质再加入其中。知道了单个岩石层的年龄也会有助于了解地球的年龄。已经发现了有40亿年年龄的岩石，这些古老的岩石都是在陆地上发现的，在海洋底部的岩石却都是更新的，海洋没有陆地持续的时间长，实际上总是海洋总是在消亡和产生的过程中。当然，这是在很长的时间范围内发生的，所以不用担心下一个夏天的沙滩（另一方面，人类制造的全球变暖会一直融化极地冰盖，在未来的几十年导致海面的危险上升）。

Rocks not only capture radioactive elements as they are formed, but also keep the magnetic orientation of their iron or other magnetically sensitive material. Like radioactivity, magnetism has helped earth scientists unravel the age of rocks. The earth's magnetic pole has not been constant over the long period of the earth's existence. North and south have flipped around on several occasions, so the north-south orientations can also provide evidence about when a rock was formed. Compasses will point north in our life-times and the lifetimes of our grandchildren, but things were not always so, and will not be so in the distant future, if the past is anything to go by.

岩石在形成的过程中并不是只有放射性元素的信息，还有铁或其他磁性敏感材料所保存的磁力线方向。就像放射现象一样，磁性也有助于科学家解开岩石年龄的奥秘。地球的磁极在其长久的历史中并不是一成不变的，南极和北极翻转过几次，所以岩石材料的南北方向也会提供岩石何时形成的证据。指南针在我们有生之年和我们孩子、孙辈的有生之年都指向北方，但不会永远这样。

Magnetism, convection, deep-sea landscapes and radiometric dating had revealed important clues about the ancient conditions of the earth. Taken together, they were enough to convince earth scientists that Wegener was almost right. Right, because continental movement did occur: sensitive measurements by satellites have confirmed the movement. But the drift or floating he suggested was wrong. Instead, John Wilson (1908-93) and others finished off the bold train of thought that Wegener had begun when they argued that the upper part of the earth's mantle is made up of a series of giant plates. These plates fit together, covering the earth, crossing the boundaries of land and sea. But they don't fit together perfectly, and it is at the joins that the fault lines appear. Understanding what goes on when one plate rubs against another, when they overlay each other or collide, is called plate tectonics. Think about the highest mountain on earth, Mount Everest in the Himalayas. Everest is as high as it is because the Himalayan Mountains were formed by two of these plates starting to collide with each other some seventy million years ago. There's no Nobel Prize in geology, but maybe there should be. Plate tectonics explains so much about earthquakes and tsunamis, mountains and rocks, fossils and living plants and animals. Our earth is a very old, but a very special place.

磁性，对流，深海风景和放射性定年法提供了远古地球的情形的重要线索，将这些线索放在一起，足以使科学家相信Wegener几乎是正确的，因为大陆确实在移动：精确卫星测量证实了运动的存在。但他提出的漂移或浮动确是错误的。John Wilson（1908-93）和其他人提出地幔的上层是由一些列巨大的板块构成的，从而否定了Wegener提出的想法。这些板块跨越了陆地和海洋的边界，一起遮住了地球。但是这些板块并不是严丝合缝的，在其连接处，就是断层线。板块地质构造学，其任务就是理解当板块互相摩擦会发生什么，当板块互相叠加或互相碰撞会发什么。想想地球上最高的山峰，喜马拉雅的珠穆朗玛峰，珠穆朗玛峰这么高是因为喜马拉雅山脉是由两个板块在七千万年碰撞形成的。地质学没有诺贝尔奖，但或许应该有。板块地质构造学解释了地震、海啸，山脉和岩石，化石和活着的动植物。我们的地球是一个非常古老，但非常特别的地方。

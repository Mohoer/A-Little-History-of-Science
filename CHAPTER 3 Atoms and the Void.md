# CHAPTER 3 Atoms and the Void 第3章 原子和虚空

In about 454 BC, the Greek historian Herodotus (c. 485-425 BC) visited Egypt. Just like us, he was astonished by the Pyramids, and by the gigantic statues - sixty feet tall - at Thebes further up the Nile. He could not quite believe just how old everything was. Egypt's glory had passed and it had already long ago been overrun by the Persians. Herodotus was living in a much younger, more vigorous society that was still on the up, and one that would conquer Egypt a century later under Alexander the Great (356-323 BC).

在大约公元前454年时，古希腊历史学家希罗多德(c. 485-425 BC)访问了埃及。就和我们一样，他为金字塔所震惊，还有尼罗河上有底比斯的60英尺高的巨大雕像。他不是很相信这所有东西都有多古老。埃及的辉煌已经过去，已经在很早前就被波斯人超过了。希罗多德生活在一个非常年轻非常有活力的社会，仍然在上升期间，一个世纪以后，由亚历山大(356-323 BC)征服了埃及。

By Herodotus's time, people who thought and wrote in Greek dominated a growing part of the eastern Mediterranean. They had written down the works of Homer, the blind poet, such as the story of how the Greeks defeated the Trojans by building and hiding in a giant horse, as well as the fantastic journey home of the Greek soldier Odysseus, who had masterminded the Trojan War. The Greeks were great ship-builders, traders and thinkers.

在希罗多德的时候，在东地中海世界，大多数人都用希腊语思考和写作。他们写下了盲人诗人荷马的著作，比如希腊人通过建造并藏在一个巨大木马中打败特洛伊人的故事，比如策划了特洛伊战争的希腊战士奥德赛精彩的回家之路。希腊人是伟大的造船者，贸易者和思想家。

One of the earliest of these thinkers was Thales (c. 625-545 BC), a merchant, astronomer and mathematician of Miletus, on the coast of what is now Turkey. Nothing that he wrote survives directly, but later authors quote him as well as telling anecdotes that illustrate what he was like. One of them says that he was once so busy looking up at the stars that he forgot to look where he was stepping and fell down a well. In another story, Thales comes out on top: because he was clever, he was able to see that there was going to be a very big olive harvest. He hired all the olive presses long before the harvest, when no one needed them, and then when the harvest came in, he was able to rent them out for a large profit. Thales was not the first absent-minded professor - and we shall meet more later - nor the only one to make money from applying his science.

这些思想家的其中一个是泰利斯(c. 625-545 BC)，一个商人、天文学家和米利都的数学家，现在位于土耳其的海岸线上。他的著作都没有直接流传下来，但后来的作家都引用他，还说着各种各样的奇闻异事，比如他长的什么样子。其中一个人说，他有一次忙着看星星，忘了正在走路，然后掉到了井里。在另一个故事中，泰利斯变得非常有名：由于他很聪明，他能看出将有一场橄榄大丰收，他在收获之前很久，在没人需要的时候，就租用了所有的橄榄压榨机，当收获开始时，他就将压榨机租了出去，获利颇丰。泰利斯并不是第一个走心的教授（我们将在后面看到），也不是唯一利用科学来赚钱的人。

Thales was said to have visited Egypt and brought back Egyptian mathematics to the Greeks. This may be just another story, like the one about him correctly predicting a total eclipse of the sun (he didn't know enough astronomy to do that). More likely, though, was the way he tried to explain many natural occurrences, such as the fertilization of the land by the flooding of the Nile, and the way earthquakes are caused by the overheating of water inside the earth's crust. For Thales, water was the chief element, and he pictured the earth as a disc floating on an enormous ocean. That sounds very funny to us, but the point is that Thales really wanted to explain things in natural, rather than supernatural, terms. The Egyptians thought that the Nile flooded because of the gods.

据说泰利斯曾经访问埃及，然后将埃及数学带回到希腊来。这可能只是另一个故事，就像那个故事一样，他正确的预言了一个日全食（他并没有足够的天文学知识来预言）。更可能的是，他解释很多自然现象的方法，比如尼罗河泛滥给土地提供了肥料，地震是由于地壳里的水过热。对于泰利斯来说，水是主要的元素，他将地球描述为在一个巨大海洋上漂浮的圆盘。这对我们来说非常可笑，但其要点是，泰利斯真的很想将事物解释的自然一点，而不是超自然的解释。埃及人就认为尼罗河泛滥是因为神的原因。

Unlike Thales, Anaximander (c. 611-547 BC), also from Miletus, believed that fire was the most important substance in the universe. Empedocles (c. 500-430 BC), from Sicily, came up with the idea of there being four elements: air, earth, fire and water. That idea is familiar to us because it became the default mode of thinkers for almost 2,000 years, until the end of the Middle Ages.

和泰利斯不一样，虽然Anaximander (c. 611-547 BC)同样来自米利都，但他相信宇宙中火是最重要的物质。西西里的Empedocles (c. 500-430 BC)认为有4种元素：空气，土，火和水。这个想法我们比较熟悉，因为这是以后2000年的思想家的主流想法，直到中世纪结束。

Being the default mode doesn't mean absolutely everyone accepted the four-element scheme as the last word. Also in Greece, and later in Rome, a group of philosophers known as the atomists believed that the world is actually made up of tiny particles called atoms. The most famous of these early atomists was Democritus, who lived around 420 BC. What we know of his ideas comes from a few fragments of his thought which other authors quoted. Democritus thought that in the universe there were lots of atoms, and that they had always existed. Atoms could not be broken down any further, nor could they be destroyed. Although they were far too small to be seen, he believed that they must be of different shapes and sizes, for this would explain why the things made of atoms have different tastes, textures and colors. But these larger things only exist because we humans taste, feel and see. In reality, Democritus insisted, there is nothing but ‘atoms and the void’, what we call matter and space.

成为主流想法并不意味着所有人都接受这种四元素的设计，同样在希腊，一群称为原子主义者的哲学家认为世界是由名为原子的粒子组成的，而后在罗马也有这样的思想。早期原子主义者中最著名的就是德谟克利特，他生活在公元前420年左右。我们是通过其他作者引用的他的只言片语来了解他的思想的。德谟克利特认为宇宙中有大量原子，他们一直存在。原子不能被进一步细分，也不能被摧毁。原子很小，所以肉眼看不到，尽管这样，他相信原子具有不同的形状和大小，这样就可以解释为什么原子组成的各种事物有不同的味道、纹理和颜色。这些宏观的事物有这样的性质，只是因为我们人可以品尝，感受，观察。德谟克利特坚持认为，在现实中只有“原子和虚空”，我们称之为物质和空间。

Atomism was not all that popular, especially Democritus's and his followers' view of how living beings 'evolved' through a kind of trial and error. One funny version suggested that there had once been a large number of the various parts of plants and animals that could potentially join up in any kind of combination- an elephant's trunk could attach to a fish, a rose petal to a potato, and so forth - before they finally all fitted together in ways that we see now. The idea was that if a dog's leg accidentally joined up to a cat, that animal would not survive and so there would be no cats with dogs' legs. After a period of time, therefore, all the dogs' legs ended up on dogs, and - thankfully - all the human legs ended up on humans. (Another ancient Greek version of evolution seems more realistic, if still a little icky: all living things were supposed to have gradually come into existence from a very ancient slime.)

原子主义者并不是都那么受欢迎，尤其是德谟克利特及其追随者关于生物通过试错的方式演化的观点。一个幽默的版本说，在各种动植物以现在的方式呈现在我们的面前之前，其的部件都曾有机会以各种方式组合，比如大象的躯干可能和鱼接在一起，玫瑰花瓣和土豆，等等。其思想是，如果一条狗的腿意外接在了一只猫的身上，这个动物不会存活下来，所以不会有猫身上长着狗腿。所以在一段时间过去后，所有的狗腿都在狗的身上，所有的人腿都在人身上（另一个演化的古希腊版本似乎更实际，但有点黏糊糊的：所有生物都是由一团古黏液进化而来）。

Because atomism doesn't see any final purpose or great design in the universe, with things just happening by luck and necessity, most people didn't like it. It is a pretty bleak view, and most Greek philosophers sought purpose, truth and beauty. The Greeks who lived at the same time as Democritus and his fellow atomists would have heard their full arguments; what we know of them is only through quotations and discussions of philosophers who came later. One atomist who lived in Roman times, Lucretius (c.100-c.55 BC), wrote a beautiful scientific poem, De rerum natura ('On the nature of things'). In this poem he described the heavens, the earth and everything on the earth, including the evolution of human societies, in terms of atomism.

由于原子主义者并没有提出宇宙的任何终极目的或伟大设计，只是由于运气和必要性才形成这样，所以大多数人并不喜欢。这是个很黯淡的光景，多数希腊哲学家寻找目的、真理和美。德谟克利特及其追随者同时期的希腊人一定了解了其所有的观点，我们是通过后世哲学家的引用和讨论才了解他们的。罗马时代的一个原子主义者，Lucretius (c.100-c.55 BC)，写了一首优美的科学诗，De rerum natura（“万物本质”）。在这首诗中他用原子主义者的词汇描述了天、地和地球上的所有事物，包括人类社会的演化。

We know the names and some of the contributions of dozens of ancient Greek scientists and mathematicians over a period of almost a thousand years. Aristotle was one of the greatest. His view of nature was so powerful that it dominated long after his death (and we'll turn to him in Chapter 5). But three people who lived after Aristotle made especially significant contributions to the ongoing development of science.

我们知道大约一千年中数十位古希腊科学家和数学家的名字和一些贡献。亚里士多德是其中最伟大的一位。他关于自然的观点非常有影响，他死后很多年一直都占主导地位（我们将在第5章讨论到他）。亚里士多德之后，有三个人对科学的持续进步做出了显著的贡献。

Euclid (c. 330-c. 260 BC) was not the first person to think about geometry (the Babylonians were pretty good at it). But he was the one who brought together, in a kind of textbook, the basic assumptions, rules and procedures of the subject. Geometry is a very practical kind of mathematics which deals with space: points, lines, surfaces, volumes. Euclid described geometrical ideas such as the way parallel lines never meet, and how the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. His great book, Elements of Geometry, was admired and studied across Europe. You might study his 'plain geometry' too one day. I hope you will admire its clear and tidy beauty.

欧几里得 (c. 330-c. 260 BC)并不是第一个思考几何学的人（巴比伦人对几何非常在行），但他是第一个将基础的几何假设、定理和推论编撰到一起形成类似教科书之类的人。几何是一种非常实用的数学，其研究对象是空间：点，线，面和体。欧几里得描述几何思想，比如平行线永不相交，三角形内角和为什么是180度。整个欧洲都在学习和敬仰他的伟大著作，几何原理。你有一天也会学习“平面几何”，我希望你能欣赏其清晰和整齐的美。

The second of the Big Three, Eratosthenes (c. 284-c. 192 BC), measured the circumference of the earth in a very simple but clever way - using geometry. He knew that on the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year, the sun was directly overhead at a place called Syene. So he measured the angle of the sun on that day at Alexandria (where he was librarian of a famous museum and library), which was around 5,000 stades due north of Syene. (A 'stade' was a Greek measurement of distance, around a tenth of a modern mile.) From these measurements he used geometry to calculate that the earth is about 250,000 stades around. So, was he close? Eratosthenes' prediction of 25,000 miles is not very far off the actual 24,901.55 miles (around the equator) that we know today. Notice that Eratosthenes thought that the earth was round. The idea that the earth was a large flat surface and that people could sail off the edge was not always believed, despite the stories that are told about Christopher Columbus and his voyage to America.

三巨头之二，埃拉托色尼(c. 284-c. 192 BC)，用几何这种聪明简单的方法测量了地球的周长。他知道在夏至日，也就是一天最长的时候，太阳处在阿斯旺（埃及城市）这个地方的正上方。所以他测量了那天亚历山大那里的太阳的角度（他在亚历山大图书博物馆做图书馆员），亚历山大在阿斯旺北约5000斯塔德（stade是古希腊距离单位，一stade约为1/10英里）。根据这些测量结果，他用几何的原理算出地球周长大约是250,000斯塔德。那么，这个结果接近正确么？埃拉托色尼25,000英里的预测与今天我们知道的实际24,901.55英里（沿赤道）相差不远。注意埃拉托色尼认为地球是圆的。尽管哥伦布远航到美洲的故事大家都知道，地球是一个巨大平面的想法并不是所有人都相信，同样也不是所有人都相信可以远航到尽头。

The last of the Big Three also worked at Alexandria, the city in northern Egypt founded by Alexander the Great. Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100-c. 178), like many scientists of the ancient world, had very wide interests. He wrote about music, geography, and the nature and behavior of light. But the work that brought him lasting fame is the Almagest, the title given to it by the Arabs. In this book, Ptolemy brought together and extended the observations of many Greek astronomers, including charts of the stars, calculations of the movements of the planets, moon, sun and stars, and the structure of the universe. He assumed, like everyone else at the time, that the earth is at the centre of everything, and that the sun, moon, planets and stars revolve around it in a circular fashion. Ptolemy was a very good mathematician, and found that by introducing a few corrections he was able to account for the movements of the planets that he, and many people before, had noticed.

三巨头的最后一个人同样也在埃及北部由亚历山大大帝建立的亚历山大城工作，Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100-c. 178)，托勒密，就像古代世界的其他科学家一样，兴趣非常广泛。他关于音乐、地质学和光的本质和行为都有著作。但让他名留青史的是《天文学大成》，书名是阿拉伯人取的（the Almagest）。在这本书里，托勒密汇总并拓展了很多古希腊天文学家的观测结果，包括星图，行星、月亮、太阳和恒星运动的计算，还有宇宙的结构。和那时的其他人一样，他假设地球是在宇宙的中心，太阳、月亮、行星和恒星都围绕地球环形运动。托勒密还是一个优秀的数学家，他发现只要对以前的数学引入一点修正，他就可以对自己和前人都注意到的行星运动做出解释。

It is quite difficult to explain the sun going around the earth when in fact the opposite happens. Ptolemy's book was essential reading for astronomers in the Islamic lands and in the European Middle Ages. It was one of the first works to be translated into Arabic, and then translated again into Latin, so much was it admired. In fact, Ptolemy was considered the equal of Hippocrates, Aristotle and Galen by many, although for us, these three get their own separate chapters.

其实是地球在绕着太阳运动，所以做出相反的解释其实是很困难的。托勒密的书在伊斯兰领土和欧洲中世纪都是天文学家的必读书。这是最早被翻译成阿拉伯文的书之一，然后又翻译成拉丁文，所以广为人所敬仰。实际上，许多人认为托勒密与希波克拉底、亚里士多德和伽林齐名，后面这三个人在本书中都有单独篇章介绍。

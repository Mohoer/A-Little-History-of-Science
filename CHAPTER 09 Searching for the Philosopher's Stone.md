# CHAPTER 9 Searching for the Philosopher's Stone
# 第9章 寻找点金石

lf you could turn your aluminum Coca-Cola can into gold, would you? You probably would, but if everybody could do it, it wouldn't be quite so amazing, since gold would become common and not worth much. The old Greek myth of King Midas, who was granted his wish that everything he touched would turn to gold, reminds us that he wasn’t being very clever. He couldn’t even eat his breakfast, since his bread became gold as soon as he touched it!

如果你可以将铝罐的可口可乐变成金子，你会这么做吗？你很可能会，但如果所有人都可以这样做，就不会让人这么吃惊了，因为金子就会变的非常普通，不会值很多钱了。Midas国王的古老希腊神话说，他许愿要能所有碰触的东西变成金子并实现了愿望，但这个故事提醒人们，这不是很聪明。因为他甚至不能吃早饭了，他一碰早饭，就会变成金子了。

King Midas was not alone in thinking that gold is special. Humans have always valued it, partly because of its wonderful feel and color, partly because it is scarce, and only kings and other rich people possessed it. If you could discover how to make gold from more common substances - from iron or lead, for instance, or even from silver - your fame and fortune would be sealed.

不止Midas国王一个认为金子是特殊的。人类一直都认为金子非常珍贵，部分是因为金子手感和颜色都非常美妙，部分因为金子是稀有的，只有国王和其他富人拥有。如果你发现了由普通物质比如铁或铅甚至是银制造金子的方法，你的名声和财富将不可限量。

Making gold in this way was one of the aims of a kind of early science called alchemy. Drop the ‘al’ from alchemy and you get a version of 'chemistry', and in fact the two are related, although these days we wouldn't call alchemy - with its dark connections to magic and religious belief - a science. However, in the past it was a thoroughly respectable activity. In his spare time, Isaac Newton (Chapter 16) dabbled in alchemy, buying a lot of scales, strangely shaped glassware, and other equipment. In other words, he set up a chemistry laboratory.

早期炼金术这种科学的一个目的就是这样制造金子。Alchemy去掉Al就会得到chemistry的另一个版本，实际上这两者是相关的，虽然现在我们不会将炼金术（因为其与魔法和宗教信仰的黑暗关系）称为科学，但在过去这完全是一个令人尊重的行为。在牛顿（第16章）的空闲时间里，他也涉猎了炼金术，买了很多天平，奇怪形状的玻璃器皿以及其他设备。换句话说，他建立了一个化学实验室。

You might have been in a laboratory, or at least seen them in pictures or films; the name simply means places where you 'labour', or work. Long ago, laboratories were where alchemists worked. Alchemy has a long history, stretching back to ancient Egypt, China and Persia. The aim of alchemists was not always simply to change less valuable ('base') metals into gold: it was also to exert power over nature, to be able to control the things that surround us. Alchemy often involved the use of magic: saying spells, or making sure you did things in exactly the correct order. The alchemist experimented with substances, to see what happened when two were mixed together, or heated. Alchemists liked to work with things that had violent reactions, like phosphorous or mercury. It could be dangerous, but imagine the rewards if you managed to find just the right combination of ingredients to make the ‘philosopher's stone’. This 'stone' (it would actually be some kind of special chemical) would then turn lead or tin into gold, or help you live forever. Just like in Harry Potter.

你可能去过一个实验室，或者至少在图片或电影中看到过；Laboratory的名字的意思就是你工作的地方。很久以前，实验室就是炼金术士工作的地方。炼金术有着很长的历史，可以追溯到古埃及、中国和波斯。炼金术士的目标并不总是简单的将不那么贵重的金属（基础金属）变为黄金，其目的还包括从自然中汲取力量，能够控制我们周围的事物。炼金术经常与魔法的运用相关：背诵咒语，或者确保每件事都按照正确的顺序做。炼金术士对各种物质进行实验，当两种物质混合到一起，或加热的时候，观察发生的现象。炼金术士喜欢对反应剧烈的物质进行实验，比如磷或水银。这可能有危险，但如果你找到了正确的组合，将原料制成了“点金石”，回报将是巨大的。这种石头（这可能实际上是某种特殊化学材料）会把铅或锡变成黄金，或可能帮助你长生不老。就像在哈利波特的故事里一样。

Harry Potter's adventures are fun, but they take place in a world of the imagination. The kinds of powers that the real magicians and alchemists dreamed of are not available in ordinary life either - even the life of the alchemist, and a lot of alchemists were tricksters, pretending to do things that they could not. But many others were honest workers who lived in a world in which everything seemed possible. In the course of their studies, they found out a lot about what we now call chemistry. They learned about distillation, for instance, the art of heating a mixture and collecting the substances that the mixture leaves behind at different times. Strong alcoholic drinks like brandy and gin are produced by distillation, which concentrates the alcohol. We call them 'spirits', a word we also use for ghosts, and for ourselves when we are being lively, or ‘spirited’. It's a word that comes from the Latin spiritus, meaning 'breath' as well as ‘spirit’. It also comes in part from alchemy.

哈利波特的冒险是非常有意思的，但发生在想象的世界中。真实的魔术师和炼金术士梦想的那种能力在正常生活中是没有的，很多炼金术士就是骗子魔术师，假装会做那些他们不会的事。但其他很多人是诚实的劳作者，生活在任何事都好像可能的世界里。在他们研究的过程中，他们发现了很多现在称之为化学的东西。比如，他们学到了蒸馏的技术，对混合物进行多次加热，收集剩余的物质。白兰地和杜松子酒这样的强酒精饮料就是通过蒸馏浓缩了酒精得到的，我们称之为烈性酒，同时也是灵魂、精神的意思的单词，当我们活泼的时候，也就是有“精神/灵魂”的时候。这也是部分起源于炼金术里的。

Most people used to believe in magic (and some still do). Many famous scholars in the past also used their studies of the secrets of nature to uncover magical forces. One remarkable man thought he had the power to change the whole practice of science and medicine. His full name is a mouthful: Theophrastus Philippus Aureolus Bombastus von Hohenheim. Try saying that name fast, and you might understand why he would want to change it to the one we know him by: Paracelsus.

过去很多人相信魔法（现在还是有一些人相信）。过去很多著名学者也用他们关于自然神秘力量的研究来揭示魔法的力量，其中一个让人印象深刻的认为他能改变整个科学与医学的实践活动，他的全名很长，Theophrastus Philippus Aureolus Bombastus von Hohenheim，试着快速说出他的名字，你就可能理解他为什么改名为我们都知道的那个：帕拉塞尔赛斯。

Paracelsus (c. 1493-1541) was born in Einsiedeln, a small town in the Swiss mountains. His father was a doctor and taught him about the natural world, about mining, and minerals, botany and medicine. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, but he grew up in the days of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, and he had many Protestant friends and supporters, as well as Roman Catholic ones. He also made many enemies. He studied with several important churchmen, and although Paracelsus was always deeply religious, his faith, like everything else about him, was unique: it was based on chemistry.

Paracelsus (c. 1493-1541)生于瑞士山区的一个小镇Einsiedeln，他的父亲是一名医生，教了他有关自然世界的知识，包括采矿、矿物、植物和医学。他是一个罗马天主教徒，但成长在马丁路德和新教改革的时代，他有很多新教徒以及罗马天主教徒的朋友和支持者，也有很多敌人。他与几位重要的牧师一起学习，虽然Paracelsus宗教信仰非常浓厚，他的信仰是唯一的，和他的其他方面一样，是基于化学的。

Paracelsus studied medicine in Italy, and was always restless, moving from place to place. He traveled all over Europe, perhaps went to England, and was certainly in North Africa. He worked as a surgeon and an ordinary doctor, treated many rich and powerful patients, and seems to have been successful. However, he never looked as if he had any money and was always badly dressed. He liked to drink in bars or pubs with ordinary rather than posh people, and his enemies said he was addicted to alcohol.

Paracelsus在意大利研究了医学，并总是不眠不休，不断从一个地方到另一个地方。他游历了整个欧洲，可能还去了英国，肯定去了北非。他以一名外科医生和普通医生的身份工作，治疗了很多富有、有权势的病人，看起来非常成功。但是，他从没有看起来很有钱，穿衣也非常不讲究。他喜欢在酒吧和普通人喝酒，不喜欢和奢侈的人一起，他的敌人说他会酗酒。

Paracelsus had only one formal job, at the university in Basel, in his native Switzerland. He insisted on lecturing in German, instead of Latin, as all the other professors did, and one of the first things he did was to burn the works of Galen in the marketplace. He had no need for Galen, Hippocrates or Aristotle. He wanted to start over again. He was sure that his view of the universe was the correct one, and it was unlike any that had gone before.

Paracelsus只有一个正式工作，在他本国瑞士Basel的大学。他坚持用德语教学，而不用拉丁语，这是其他所有教授都用拉丁语，他第一件做的事就是把盖伦的著作在市场上烧掉。他不需要盖伦、希波克拉底或亚里士多德。他希望重新开始，他非常坚信他关于宇宙的观点是正确的，这和以往的都不一样。

Shortly after his bonfire, he was forced to leave town to continue his wanderings, staying a few months here, perhaps a year or so there, but always restless and ready to pack his few things and try somewhere else. He would take his manuscripts and chemical apparatus, and probably little else. Travel was always slow, on foot, on horseback or in a cart, along roads that were often muddy and dangerous. Given his way of life, it is amazing that he accomplished anything at all. In fact, while treating many patients, he also wrote many books, looked at the world around him, and was always doing chemical experiments.

他热闹了之后没多久，就被迫离开城镇，继续四处游荡，通常都是在这里待几个月，在那里待一年，但永远都是不眠不休，准备好打包自己的很少的东西，到其他地方尝试生活。他随身带的可能就是手稿和化学实验装置，其他的可能就极少了。旅行永远是很慢的步行、骑马或马车，路上经常是泥泞危险的。这样的生活方式，能有任何成就都是很让人吃惊的。实际上，在治疗了很多病人的同时，他也写了很多书，观察他周围的世界，不断经常做化学实验。

Chemistry was his passion. When he said he didn't need the works of the ancients to guide his own studies, he meant it. He had no time for the four elements of air, earth, fire and water. Instead, for him, there were three basic 'principles' - salt, sulphur and mercury - into which everything could ultimately be separated. Salt gives things their shape, or solidness; sulphur is the reason why things can burn; and mercury is responsible for a thing's smoky or fluid state. Paracelsus interpreted the experiments in his laboratory by these three principles. He was interested in how acids can dissolve things, and how alcohol can be frozen. He burned substances and carefully examined what was left. He distilled many liquids and collected what was given off, as well as noting what was left behind. In short, he spent a lot of time in his laboratory, seeking to master nature.

化学是他酷爱的东西。当他说他不需要古人的著作来指引他的研究的时候，他真的就是这个意思。他不相信气、土、火、水四元素说。相反，对于他来说有三条基本原则，盐、硫磺和水银，所有事物都可以最终分解成这三种物质。盐塑造了物质的形状，或者说固态度；硫磺是物质可以燃烧的原因；水银是物体可以呈气态或液态的原因。Paracelsus用三条原则解释了实验室中的实验。他对酸可以溶解物质和酒精可以冻结感到有兴趣，他燃烧了很多物质，仔细检查了燃烧剩下的东西。他蒸馏了很多液体，收集了蒸发掉的东西，也记录了剩下了东西。简单来说，他在实验室花了很多时间，寻找掌握自然的方法。

Paracelsus believed that his chemical experiments would help him understand how the world works, and that chemistry would be the source of many new treatments for disease. Before him, most drugs that doctors used came from plants, and although Paracelsus sometimes used herbal remedies in his own medical practice, he preferred to give his patients medicines that he had studied in his laboratory. Mercury was a particular favorite of his. Mercury is actually very poisonous, but Paracelsus used it as an ointment for skin diseases, and believed it was the best remedy for a disease that had become common throughout Europe. This was syphilis, a disease that is usually spread by sexual contact, which causes horrible rashes on the skin, destroys people's noses, and usually kills them. An epidemic of syphilis broke out in Italy in the 1490s, around the time of Paracelsus's birth, killing many people. By the time he was a doctor, syphilis was so widespread that almost all doctors would have seen patients with it (and more than a few doctors suffered from it themselves). Paracelsus wrote on this new disease, describing many of its symptoms and recommending mercury to treat it. Although mercury could make your teeth fall out and your breath smell horribly, it got rid of the rash, so doctors used it for many years to treat syphilis and other diseases that caused rashes.

Paracelsus相信他的化学实验会使他逐渐理解世界是怎样工作的，化学会发展出新的疾病治疗方法。在他之前，医生用的药物大多来自植物，虽然Paracelsus有时会在医疗实践中使用草药，但他还是比较喜欢给病人用他在实验室研究出的药。水银是他的最爱。实际上水银毒性很大，但Paracelsus将之用作治疗皮肤病的药膏，并相信对于一种在整个欧洲广泛传播的疾病来说是最好的，这就是梅毒，通常是通过性接触传播的，会导致皮肤严重发疹，鼻子损害，最后让病人死去。15世纪90年代在意大利有过一次梅毒大传染，正是在Paracelsus出生左右的时间，杀死了很多人。当他是个医生的时候，正是梅毒肆虐的时候，几乎所有医生都看过梅毒病人（也有不少医生本身就有梅毒）。Paracelsus关于这种新疾病进行了写作，描述了其很多症状，推荐用水银来治疗。虽然水银会使人的牙齿脱落，呼吸味道恐怖，但确实能去除发疹，所以很多年来医生都这样治疗梅毒以及其他会导致发疹的疾病。

Paracelsus described many other diseases. He wrote about the injuries and illnesses suffered by those who worked down the mines, especially diseases of the lungs caused by horrible working conditions and long hours. Paracelsus's concern for lowly miners reflected his life spent among the ordinary people.

Paracelsus还描述了很多其他疾病。他描写了矿井里工作的工人的外伤和疾病，尤其是恶劣的工作环境和长时间的工作导致肺部疾病。Paracelsus对底层矿工疾病的关心反应了他与普通人一起的生活。

Hippocrates, Galen and other doctors before Paracelsus thought disease was the result of an imbalance within the body. For Paracelsus, however, disease resulted from a force that was outside the body. This 'thing' (he called it an ens, a Latin word which means a 'being' or 'substance') attacks the body, causes us to fall sick, and creates the kind of changes that doctors look for as clues to understand what the disease is. The ens could be a pimple or abscess, or a stone in the kidney. The important breakthrough that Paracelsus made was separating the patient and the disease. This way of thinking came into its own much later with the discovery of germs.

Paracelsus之前的希波克拉底、盖伦和其他医生认为疾病的原因是体内体液的不平衡。但对Paracelsus来说，疾病是因为体外的原因导致的。这个“东西”（他称之为ens，是拉丁语，意思是物质）攻击身体，导致我们生病，产生身体上的变化，医生通过观察这种变化，寻找理解疾病的线索。这个“东西”可以是一个疙瘩或脓肿，或者肾脏里的结石。Paracelsus做出的重大突破在于将病人和疾病分离了开来。这种思考方式在很久以后随着细菌的发现得到了证实。

Paracelsus wanted to start science and medicine on the new foundations he provided. He said again and again that people ought not to read books but to see and experiment for themselves. He did, of course, want others to read the books he himself wrote, some of which were not published until after he died. His real message was ‘Don't bother to read Galen, read Paracelsus’. His world was full of magical forces, which he believed he could understand and tame in the service of his science and medicine. His own alchemical dream was not just turning base metals into gold; rather, he sought to master all the magical and mysterious forces of nature.

Paracelsus希望从他建立的新基础上发展科学与医学。他不断的说，人们不应当去读书，而应该去亲自看看实验结果。他当然会希望人们去阅读他写的书，有些直到他死后才得到发表。他的真实意思是，“不要去读盖伦的书，来读Paracelsus的书”。他的世界里满是魔法力量，他相信他可以理解并驯化科学和医学的力量。他自己的炼金术士梦想不止是把普通金属变成黄金，他更希望寻找掌握所有大自然的魔法和神秘力量。

He had a few followers during his lifetime, and many more after his death. They called themselves Paracelsians and continued to try to change medicine and science as he had done. They experimented in the laboratory and used chemical remedies in their medical practices. They tried, like Paracelsus, to control the forces of nature through natural magic.

他一生中有几个追随者，死后追随者更多。他们自称为Paracelsus学派，并坚持以他的方式来改变科学和医学。他们在实验室中实验，在医学实践中使用化学疗法。他们就像Paracelsus一样尝试通过自然的魔力来控制大自然的力量。

The Paracelsians always remained outside the mainstream. The majority of doctors and scientists were unwilling to totally reject the legacy of the Ancients. Nevertheless, Paracelsus's message was increasingly picked up. People started looking at the world for themselves. In 1543, two years after his death, two books were published, one on anatomy, one on astronomy, which also challenged the authority of the Ancients. The universe was being looked at anew.

Paracelsus学派不是主流学派。绝大多数医生和科学家不愿意完全拒绝古人的智慧遗产。尽管这样，Paracelsus的信息被越来越多的人承认。人们开始通过自己来观察周围的世界。在1543年，也就是他去世后2年，发表了两本书，一本是关于解剖学的，一本是关于天文学的，都挑战了古代先贤的权威。人们开始通过全新的角度观察这个宇宙。

# CHAPTER 13 Round and Round: Harvey
# 第13章 不断循环：哈维

The words 'cycle' and 'circulation' are both based on the original Latin word for ‘circle’. Going through a cycle, or circulating, means you just keep moving and eventually come back to where you started from, without necessarily noticing you are back at the beginning. There are not many perfect circles in nature, but there is a lot of circulation. The earth circles around the sun. Water circulates by evaporating from the earth and falling again as rain. Many birds migrate long distances each year, then return to the same area to breed and start their yearly cycle over again. Indeed, the whole natural process of birth, growth and death, followed by the repeat of the cycle in a new generation, is a kind of circulation.

“循环”与“流通”都是基于拉丁文中的“圆”。走完一个循环，意思是持续运动最后回到开始的地方，而没必要注意回到了开始。自然中没有多少完美的圆，但有很多循环。地球围绕太阳循环转动，水循环就是从地上蒸发，然后通过降雨回到地上。许多鸟儿每年长途迁徙，然后回到生育和开始的相同的地方，开始一年的新循环。确实，自然整个的出生、成长、死亡的过程，然后进入下一代的循环，也是一种循环。

There are also a lot of cycles, or circulations, within our bodies. One of the most important of these involves the heart and blood. Each drop of blood circulates through our bodies about fifty times every hour of our lives. That varies, of course, depending on what we're doing: if we're running, and our hearts have to beat faster, the circulation time is shortened; when we're asleep, our hearts beat more slowly and it takes longer for a drop of blood to get back to the heart. These days, we learn all this in school, but it was not always so clear-cut. The man who discovered that our blood circulates was an English doctor named William Harvey (1578-1657).

我们体内也有很多循环。最重要的一种是与心脏和血液相关的。我们生命中每滴血都在每小时内循环通过我们身体大约50次，根据我们所做事情的不同次数会有所变化：如果我们在跑步，那么心脏跳动就会快一些，循环时间就短一点；当我们睡觉的时候，心脏的跳动就会变慢，血液循环的时间就会长一些。今天我们在学校里可以学到所有这些，但这并不总是那么清晰易懂的。发现血液循环的那个人是一位英国医生，名叫William Harvey（1578-1657）。

Harvey's father was a farmer who became a successful merchant, an occupation that five of Harvey's six brothers followed too. William Harvey chose medicine as a career, however, and after finishing his medical studies at Cambridge University in 1600, he went to the University of Padua, where Vesalius had worked a few years before, and where Galileo was currently investigating astronomy and physics.

Harvey的父亲是一个农场主，后来成为一位成功的商人，他的其他5个儿子也都成为了商人。但William Harvey选择了医生作为职业，在1600年完成剑桥大学的学业时，他去了Padua大学，几年前Vesalius在这里工作过，而且Galileo正在这里研究天文学和物理学。

One of Harvey's medical teachers at Padua was Fabrizi of Acquapendente (1537-1619). Fabrizi was continuing the research tradition started long before by Aristotle, and it inspired Harvey. Teacher and pupil absorbed two important lessons from Aristotle. First, that in living creatures, including human beings, the organs in our bodies have the form, or structure, they have because of the work they have to do. Our bones and muscles, for instance, are put together so that we can run, or pick up things, and unless there is something wrong with us we don't even notice them functioning in the way they seemed designed for. Aristotle also believed that everything within plants and animals had a specific purpose, or function, because the Creator wouldn't design any parts that were useless. Our eyes are constructed the way they are so that we can see; so are the other parts of our bodies, our stomach, liver, lungs and heart. Each organ has a special structure, in order to perform its own particular function. This approach to understanding the way our bodies work was called ‘living anatomy’ and it was especially helpful in figuring out the 'logic' of how our bodies operate. It was clear to doctors that bones were hard, and kept their shape, because they have to support our bodies when we are walking or running. Our muscles are softer and springier because their contraction and relaxation helps us move. Yet it was not so obvious that the heart, and its relationship to the blood and blood vessels, could be understood using the same logic. Perhaps we should say that the heart now fits into this way of thinking about our bodily functions because we have Harvey to guide us.

Harvey在Padua大学里的一个医学老师是Acquapendente的Fabrizi(1537-1619)。Fabrizi沿袭着比亚里士多德还早开始的研究传统，这启发了Harvey。老师和学生从亚里士多德那里学到了重要的两课。第一，在所有生物，包括人类中，身体器官有一定的形式或结构，这是因为它们必须要做一些工作。比如我们的骨头和肌肉是在一起的，所以我们可以跑或捡起东西，我们不会注意到这些，直到有一部分出了问题，才会发现它们就是为了这些功能设计出来的。亚里士多德也相信动植物体内所有东西都有特定的目的，或功能，因为造物主不会设计什么没用的部件。我们的眼睛造成这样，所以我们能看东西，其他身体部分也是这样，胃、肝脏、肺和心脏。每个器官都有其特殊的结构，其目的都是为了完成其特殊的功能。这种理解我们身体工作的方法叫做“活体剖析”，这在解释我们身体工作逻辑的时候特别有用。非常清楚，骨头是硬的，可以保持形状，因为骨头在我们走或跑的时候必须支撑身体。我们的肌肉是软的、有弹力的，因为肌肉的收缩和放松可以帮助我们移动。但用这种逻辑理解，心脏与血液、血管的关系就没那么明显了。也许我们可以说，心脏是我们现在理解的身体机能，是由于Harvey在指引我们理解。

Second, Aristotle insisted on the central role that the heart and blood play in our lives, after observing the tiny beating heart which was the first sign of life in the speck of a chick in an egg. Aristotle convinced Harvey that the heart is at the centre of life. And the heart and circulation became the centre of Harvey's medical career.

第二，亚里士多德观察到鸡蛋变成鸡的过程中第一个生命特征就是跳动的心脏，所以坚持认为心脏与血液是我们生命中的中心角色。亚里士多德使Harvey相信心脏是生命的中心，心脏与血液循环成为了Harvey医学生涯的中心。

Harvey's own teacher, Fabrizi, also discovered something that became crucial to Harvey: that many of the larger veins have valves in them. These valves are always situated so that the blood can go only one way: towards the heart. Fabrizi thought that their function was to prevent the blood pooling in our legs, or from rushing down from the brain with too great a force. Harvey made use of all these lessons when he returned to England after he completed his studies at Padua.

Harvey的老师Fabrizi也发现了一些对Harvey很关键的东西，那就是一些较大的静脉血管中会有瓣膜。这些瓣膜的作用就是使血液单向流动，也就是流向心脏。Fabrizi认为它们的作用是避免血液在腿中淤积，或避免血液从大脑过于快速的冲向心脏。Harvey结束在Padua的学习回到英国后，这些知识对他都非常有用。

Harvey's career went from strength to strength. He set up a medical practice in London, got a job at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and was also soon being asked to lecture to surgeons on anatomy and physiology. He became a doctor to two kings of England, James I and then his son Charles I. Being associated with Charles I didn't help Harvey during this period, especially after the king was removed from the throne by a group of Protestants called Puritans. On one occasion, Harvey's house was attacked and burned, and with it many manuscripts for books he hoped to publish. This was a great loss to science, since Harvey had been investigating many things including breathing, muscles, and how animals form from fertilized eggs. King Charles had even allowed some of his own royal animals to be used in Harvey's experiments.

Harvey的事业不断取得成功。他开始在伦敦行医，在St Bartholomew医院找到了工作，同时受邀给外科医生讲授解剖学和生理学。他成为英国两位国王的御医，詹姆士一世和他的儿子查理一世。与查理一世的关系在这段时间里并没有帮助Harvey，尤其是当一群新教徒，即清教徒将国王赶下皇位之后。有一次，Harvey的房子受到了攻击，被烧掉，也烧掉了他希望出版成书的很多手稿。这是科学的重大损失，因为Harvey研究了很多东西包括呼吸、肌肉，以及动物怎么从受精卵成长。查理国王甚至Harvey在实验中使用他的一些皇家动物。

Harvey was always fascinated by blood. He thought it was really the essential part of what it means to be alive. He too cracked open some eggs and saw that the first sign of life was a speck of blood, pulsing in a rhythmical way. The same was true for other animals he examined when they were still embryos (still developing in the egg or their mother's womb). The heart, which has long been associated with blood, was also fascinating to Harvey. Everyone knew that when the heart stopped beating, the person or animal died. So, while blood was essential to the beginning of life, life ended when the heart stopped beating.

Harvey永远对血液非常着迷，他认为这是活着的生命的基本部分。他也敲开了一些鸡蛋，发现第一个生命的迹象就是一点血液有节奏的脉动，他也研究了其他动物在胚胎（仍然在蛋或母体子宫中发育）时，也是这样的。心脏很久以来就被与血液联系到一起，这也让Harvey感到着迷。所有人都知道当心脏停止跳动的时候，人或者动物就会死去。所以，血液是生命开始的基础，而心脏停止跳动生命就会结束。

Most of the time our heart beats without us thinking twice about it. But sometimes you can actually feel your heart beating, for example, when you are nervous or scared, or when you have been exercising, and you feel your heart pummeling against your chest wall: duh-dum, duh-dum, duh-dum. Harvey wanted to understand the 'motions' of the heart, that is, what actually happens in each heartbeat. In every beat of the heart, the heart contracts (a process known as the 'systole') and then relaxes (the 'diastole'). He dissected many live animals in order to observe their beating hearts, especially snakes and other cold-blooded animals (those which can't regulate their own body temperatures). Their hearts beat much slower than ours do, so he could see the beating more easily. He saw how the valves inside the heart open and close, in every heartbeat, in a regular sequence of events. During contraction, the valves between the chambers of the heart closed, and those that connected the heart to the blood vessels opened. As the heart relaxed, the reverse happened, and the internal valves opened, while those that sat between the heart and the blood vessels (the pulmonary artery and the aorta) shut. It occurred to Harvey that these valves act just like the valves of the veins that his teacher Fabrizi had discovered, and that their function seemed to keep the blood going in a constant direction.

多数时间内，心脏跳动不需要我们思考。但有时候你确实可以感受到心脏跳动，比如，当你紧张或害怕的时候，或者当你锻炼的时候，你会感到心脏击打胸腔：咚-咚-咚。心脏想理解心脏的运动，也就是，每次心脏跳动时，究竟发生了什么。在每次心脏跳动时，心脏收缩然后舒张。他解剖了很多活的动物来观察跳动的心脏，尤其是蛇和其他冷血动物（那些不能调节自己体温的）。它们的心脏跳动比我们慢得多，所以可以更容易的观察跳动。他看到了心脏内的瓣膜每次心脏都会有规律的张开关闭，当收缩时，心室间的瓣膜关闭，而连接心脏与血管的打开；而舒张时，发生相反的情况，即内部瓣膜打开，心脏与血管（肺动脉与主动脉）之间的瓣膜关闭。这使Harvey想起，这些瓣膜的行为方式与他老师Fabrizi发现的静脉瓣膜非常类似，其作用就是保证血液运动方向不变。

Harvey did several experiments to help others see what he was thinking. One was very simple. He placed a tight bandage (called a tourniquet) around an arm: if it was very tight, so no blood could get into the arm at all, the hand became very pale; if he loosened it a bit, the blood could get in but could not get back to the heart, and the hand became very red. This showed that the blood entered the arm at a certain pressure, which the tight tourniquet blocked entirely. Loosening the strap allowed blood to come in through the arteries, but not to get back out of the arm through the veins.

Harvey做了几个实验来帮助别人理解自己的思想。有一个很简单，他将一个绷带（止血带）绑紧一条胳膊，如果很紧，那么没有血液可以进入胳膊，手就会变得非常苍白；如果松开一点，血液就可以进入，但无法回到心脏，手就会变得非常红。这说明了血液以一定的血压进入胳膊，这样紧绷的止血带可以完全阻挡血液；松开带子使血液可以沿动脉进入，但无法通过静脉流回。

Having looked at so many hearts and thought so deeply about them, Harvey made an important leap in our understanding of what they do. He worked out that in a very short space of time more blood than was contained in the entire body passes through the heart. And it was impossible to make enough blood for each new heartbeat to pump new blood, let alone for a human body to contain it all. Therefore, the blood must go from the heart with each beat, travel through the arteries, into the veins, and return to the heart to begin a new cycle of ‘circulation’.

Harvey看过了很多心脏，对其进行了很多思考，在对它们工作的理解上有了一次飞跃。他弄懂了在很短的时间内整个身体内的血液是多于流经心脏的血液的，不可能每次心跳都抽取新的血液，更不要说一个人体包含所有血液，所以，每次心跳血液必须从心脏出发，经过动脉，进入静脉，然后回到心脏再开始新的血液循环流通。

‘I began privately to consider that the blood had a movement, as it were, in a circle’. He wrote these words (in Latin) in 1628, in a short book called De motu cordis ('On the motion of the heart'). It seems as if he started out to write something on the contraction and relaxation of the heart, and ended up discovering what function these processes perform. He worked out that blood is pumped into the lungs (from the heart's right chamber), and also into the biggest artery, the aorta, from the left. From the aorta, the blood goes into the smaller arteries that branch off it, and then transfers to the veins, where the valves ensure that it flows in the correct direction and is returned to the right side of the heart through the largest vein, the vena cava.

“我开始私下里认为血液有一种运动，而且是一种环形的”，他在1628年用拉丁文这样写到，在一本叫《论心脏的运动》的书中。好像他开始于写作心脏的收缩和舒张，最终发现了这些过程完成的功能。他弄懂了血液是泵送到肺部的（从心脏的右心室），也泵送到最大的动脉，主动脉，从左心室。血液从主动脉进入更小的动脉分支，然后输送到静脉中，静脉中的瓣膜会保证血液流向正确的方向，然后从最大的静脉，腔静脉回到心脏右部。

Like Vesalius, Harvey always insisted that he wished to learn about the structures and functions of the body from his own investigations, not simply from books written by others. Unlike Vesalius, he worked mostly with living animals, not human corpses. He did not set out to challenge 2,000 years of medical teaching about the heart and blood, but he knew his findings would be controversial, because they showed that Galen's theory of the heart and blood was wrong. He defended his ideas against criticism from some people, mostly followers of Galen, who thought that his ideas were too extreme. But there was one important gap in his theory: he could not answer the crucial question of how the blood gets from the smallest arteries to the smallest veins, to begin its return journey back to the heart.

和Vesalius一样，Harvey一直坚持他能从自己的调查中学习身体的结构和功能，而不是简单的从别人的书里学。和Vesalius不一样的是，他大多用活的动物实验，而不是人的尸体。他无意挑战2000年医学里心脏与血液的教授内容，但他知道他的发现会是有争议的，因为这说明了盖伦关于心脏和血液的理论是错误的。一些人对他的观点进行了批评，主要是盖伦的追随者，认为他的观点太过极端，他为自己的观点进行了辩护。他的理论中有一个重要的缺口：他不能回答一个关键问题，血液是怎样从最小的动脉流到最小的静脉中的，然后才开始回流到心脏。

That bit of the puzzle was solved about the time of Harvey's death by one of his Italian disciples, Marcello Malpighi (1628-94), who was an expert at using a new instrument called the microscope, which had been around since the 1590s but was improved by Malpighi's time. He was able to look more closely than anyone before at the delicate structures of the lung, the kidneys and other organs, and he uncovered the tiny channels connecting the smallest arteries and veins: the capillaries. Harvey's 'circle' was complete.

这个问题在大约Harvey去世时得到了解决，是由他的一个意大利徒弟，Marcello Malpighi (1628-94)解决的，他是一种新仪器，称为显微镜，使用方面的专家，显微镜发明于16世纪90年代，在Malpighi时代得到了改进。与前人相比，他可以更近距离的仔细观察肺部、肾脏以及其他器官的精细结构，然后他发现了连接最小的动脉和最小的静脉的细小管道：毛细血管。Harvey的循环完整了。

Through his ground-breaking work, Harvey had shown what careful experimentation could uncover, and as his ideas became more widely accepted, people recognized him as a founder of experimentation in biology and medicine. This encouraged others to look for themselves and investigate other bodily functions such as what happens in the lungs when we breathe, or in the stomach when we digest our food. And, like Vesalius and Galileo before him, he helped people realize that scientific knowledge can increase, and that we can know more about nature than equally clever people who lived a thousand (or even fifty) years before us.

贯穿于他开创性的著作中，Harvey都展示了小心的实验可以发现的东西；随着他的观点广为接受，人们承认他是实验生物学和实验药学的鼻祖。这鼓励了其他人寻找自我，研究其他身体功能，比如我们呼吸时肺部发生了什么，我们消化食物时胃里发生了什么。而且，就像他之前的Vesalius和伽利略一样，他帮助人们意识到，科学知识是可以增长的，我们可以比一千（或甚至五十）年前与我们一样聪明的人知道更多关于自然的知识。

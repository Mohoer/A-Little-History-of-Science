# CHAPTER 29 Tabling the Elements
# 第29章 元素制表

Every time we mix ingredients to bake something, we are using chemical reactions. The fizzing as we descale our kettles is chemistry at work for us. The plastic water bottles we carry, the colored clothes we wear, are possible because of chemical knowledge gained over hundreds of years.

每次我们加入作料烘焙什么东西，我们都利用了化学反应。当我们去除水壶里的水垢时，产生的泡沫，就是工作里的化学。我们装水的塑料杯子，我们穿的有色衣服，都是利用几百年积累下来的化学知识制作出来的。

Chemistry became modern in the nineteenth century. Let's recap a little. At the beginning of the century, chemists embraced Dalton's original idea of the atom, as you read in Chapter 21. Then they made great strides in creating a special language that they would all understand, whatever country they came from. They had the system of symbols for elements, such as H2 for two atoms of hydrogen. Everyone agreed that the atom was the smallest unit of matter. They used the word element for a substance made of only one kind of atom (carbon, for example). A compound was two or more elements bonded together chemically. You could break down compounds into elements (ammonium could be broken down into nitrogen and hydrogen), but once you got to the individual elements, you couldn't break things down any further.

化学在19世纪变得现代起来。让我们重新简单叙述一下。在19世纪初期，化学家采用Dalton的原子学说，这部分在第21章阐述。接着他们在创造一门各国化学家都懂的语言上有了重大进展，他们创造了表示化学元素的符号，比如H2表示两个氢原子。所有人都同意，原子是物质的最小单位。用元素来代表一种原子构成的物质（比如碳），化合物则代表两种或更多的元素化学结合构成的物质。你可以将化合物分解为元素（氨可以被分解为氮和氢），但分解为元素以后就不能再继续分解了。

Although atoms were clearly not the hard tiny balls that Dalton had suggested, it was extremely difficult to say exactly what they were. Instead, chemists began to discover a lot about how they acted when placed with other atoms or compounds. Some elements were simply not interested in reacting with others, no matter what you did. Some would react so violently together that you had to guard against an explosion. Sometimes, however, you could get a reaction if you helped to get it started. Oxygen and hydrogen could be placed together in a flask and nothing happened. If you put a spark to it, you had to watch out! Despite the dramatic explosion, the reaction produced nothing more unusual than water. At the other extreme, if magnesium and carbon were put together in a flask with no air, you could heat them forever and nothing would happen. Let in a bit of air, and you would be greeted with bright light and an awful lot of heat.

虽然原子不是Dalton所说的坚硬的小球，但却是很难明确表述到底是什么。化学家开始研究当不同的原子或原子与化合物在一起时会发生什么。有的元素不怎么活跃，不管怎样都不太与其他物质反应。有的元素则非常活跃，反应起来非常剧烈，有时候必须防止其爆炸。有时候在人为控制下可以发生一个化学反应。氧气和氢气放在一个烧瓶里什么也不会发生，但如果有一丁点火花的话，那就必须小心了！虽然爆炸很剧烈，但产生的东西只有水。在另一个极端情况下，如果镁和碳放在真空的烧瓶中，即使加热也不会发生什么，但如果有了一丁点空气，就可以看到发出非常明亮的光和大量的热。

Chemists were aware of these various chemical reactions. They also became curious about what caused them and the patterns revealed in the laboratory. They set about their experiments in two main ways: synthesis and analysis. Synthesis is putting elements together: you start with single elements or simple compounds, and when these react with each other, you look at the results - at what has been made. Analysis is the reverse: you start with the more complex compound, do something to break it down, and, by looking at the end products, try to understand the compound that you started with. These methods began to give chemists a good idea of what many fairly simple compounds consisted of. It was then easier to create more complicated compounds, by adding new bits to substances they had a fair idea about.

化学家知道这多种多样的化学反应，他们也对化学反应的原因和实验室中的反应模式感到好奇。他们主要将实验分成两类：合成和分解。合成是将几种元素放到一起：开始将简单元素或简单的化合物，当它们互相反应后，观察最后得到的结果，看生成了什么东西。分解是相反的：开始是一种复杂的化合物，分解它，看看最后产物，然后尝试理解开始的化合物。这些方法使化学家对很多简单化合物的组成有了很好的了解，然后再制造更复杂的化合物就简单一些了，就是通过往已知的物质中一点点添加东西。

From all these experiments, two things became particularly clear. First, as we have seen, the elements themselves each seemed to have either positive or negative tendencies. As the old saying goes, opposites attract. For example, sodium, a naturally positive element, combined easily with chlorine, a negative one, to make sodium chloride (which is just the table salt we sprinkle over food). The positive and negative cancel each other out, so salt is neutral. All stable compounds (those that won't change unless something is done to them) are neutral even though they are made up of elements that were not necessarily so. Combining sodium and chlorine is an example of synthesis. You can do chemical analysis of the salt you've made. Dissolve the salt in water, put the solution in an electric field with its positive and negative poles, and it will split up. Sodium migrates to the negative pole, chlorine dances to the positive one. Hundreds of similar experiments convinced the chemists that the atoms of such elements do indeed have these positive and negative characteristics. And these characteristics play an essential role in determining what happens when elements react with each other.

通过这些实验，有两件事变得很很明显。第一，就像我们看到的那样，每种元素都有阳性或阴性的倾向。就像古老谚语说的那样，异性相吸。比如，钠，天然就是阳性元素，与氯这种阴性元素就很容易结合，产生氯化钠（就是我们撒在食物里面的食盐）。阳性和阴性互相抵消，所以氯化钠是中性的。所有稳定的化合物（除非有外界作用，不会改变）都是中性的，即使制造其的元素不是中性的。钠和氯的结合是合成的一个例子。你可以对做出的食盐进行化学分解。将食盐溶化到水里，在溶液中插入正负电极，然后就会分解。钠聚集到负极，氯聚集到正极。几百个类似的实验使化学家相信这些元素的原子的确含有阳性和阴性的特征。这些特征在决定元素之间反应的行为时起着重要的作用。

Second, some groups of atoms may stick together during experiments, and these collective atoms can act like a single unit. These units were called 'radicals' and they too are positive or negative. They were especially important in 'organic' chemistry, where chemists were coming to understand a whole series of related compounds (all of which contained carbon), such as ethers, alcohols or benzenes. Benzenes were a fascinating group, each with a ring-like structure. Many chemists were eager to try to classify these organic groups, to understand what they were made of and how they reacted - not least because a lot of the substances were becoming valuable to industry. Increasingly, such industrial chemicals were made not in small laboratories, but in factories. The demand was growing for fertilizers, paints, medicines, dyes and, especially from the 1850s, oil products. The modern chemical industry had begun, and chemistry became a career, not just an indulgence for the curious or the rich.

第二，一些原子在实验中可能聚到一起，这个原子集合体会像一个单元那样。这些单元称之为“原子团”，他们也可以是阳性的或者阴性的。这在有机化学中尤其重要，化学家在有机化学中理解一些列相关的化合物（都包含碳），比如乙醚，乙醇或苯。苯是一个非常迷人的集合体，每个都有一个环状结构。很多化学家急于对这些有机化合物进行分类，理解它们是由什么组成的，怎样反应，尤其是很多这种物质在工业中越来越有价值。这些工业化合物越来越多的是在工厂中制造的，而不是在实验室中制造的。对于化肥、颜料、药物、染色剂的需求，尤其是19世纪50年代后期对石头产品的需求正在增长。现代化学工业已经开始了，化学成为了一种事业，而不是对好奇心或财富的向往。

The elements, too, have their own unique chemical and physical properties. As more and more were discovered, chemists found certain patterns. It appeared that individual atoms of some elements, such as hydrogen, sodium or chlorine, only wanted to combine with other atoms singly. For example, a single atom of hydrogen and one of chlorine combined to make a powerful acid, hydrochloric acid (HCl). A single atom of others, such as oxygen, barium and magnesium, seemed to have a double capacity to combine with other atoms or radicals, and so it takes two atoms of hydrogen to combine with oxygen to make water. Some elements were even more flexible, and there were always exceptions that made any hard and fast rules difficult to set down. Elements (and radicals) also differed in their eagerness to enter into chemical reactions. Phosphorous was so active that it had to be treated carefully; silicon was generally sluggish and much less dangerous.

这些元素也都有着独特的化学或物理性质。当发现越来越多时，化学家找到了特定的模式。有一些元素的单原子，比如氢，钠和氯，只会与其他原子单独结合。比如，一个氢原子和一个氯原子结合形成一种强酸，盐酸HCl。其他一些单原子，比如氧，钡和镁，似乎在与其他原子或原子团结合时容量翻倍，，所以要两个氢原子与氧原子结合来形成水。有些元素则更灵活，对任何规则都有一些例外情况。元素（和原子团）在化学反应的活跃度上也非常不一样。磷非常活跃，必须要小心处理；而硅则非常稳定，危险性也小的多。

The elements differed dramatically in their physical properties, too. At normal temperatures, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and chlorine were gases; mercury and sodium were liquids. Most were naturally solids: metals like lead, copper, nickel and gold. Many other elements, above all carbon and sulphur, both intensively studied, were normally in a solid state. Put most solids in an ordinary furnace and they can easily be melted, and sometimes even vaporized (turned into a gas). Liquid mercury and sodium were also easy (if dangerous) to vaporize. Nineteenth-century chemists were not able to get low enough temperatures to turn gases like oxygen and nitrogen into liquids, much less solids. But they recognized their problem was a merely technical one. In principle, each element could exist in each of the three states of matter: solid, liquid and gas.

各种元素在物理特性上也非常不一样。在常温下，氢气、氧气、氮气和氯气都是气体，水银和钠则是液体。大多数则都是固体：比如像铅、铜、镍和金这样的金属。许多其他元素，尤其是碳和硫，研究的非常多，正常都是固态。多数固体放入常见的熔炉中都会熔化，有时候甚至气化。液态水银和钠也可以很容易气化（也很危险）。19世纪的化学家不能将温度降的足够低以得到液氧和液氮，更不用说固体。但他们也认为这只是一个技术上的问题。原则上来说，每种元素都会有三种存在状态：固态、液态和气态。

By the 1850s, chemistry was coming of age, and in this exciting period there was much to debate, about the relative weights of atoms, how molecules (groups of atoms) were bound together, the differences between 'organic' and 'inorganic' compounds, and much else. In 1860, something happened that helped create modern chemistry. It was something that today seems quite ordinary, but was unusual then: an international meeting. In the days before telephone, emails and easy travel, scientists rarely met and they communicated mostly by letters. Hearing another scientist from abroad talk about their work, with an open discussion afterwards, was a rare event. International meetings began in the 1850s, helped by more available travel by train and steamship, and they allowed people to meet and talk with their colleagues from other countries. They also announced to the world a belief widely shared by the scientific community: that science itself was objective and international, and above religion and politics, which often divided people and set whole nations at war with one another.

到19世纪50年代，化学已经发展成熟，在这个激动人心的阶段，有非常多的讨论问题，有关原子的相对质量，分子（原子集合）的结合方式，有机物和无机物的区别，以及其他。在1860年，有件事发生了，这产生了现代化学。在现代看来这是稀松平常的事，但在当时却非常不平常：一场国际会议。在有电话、电子邮件和轻松旅行之前的日子里，科学家极少聚到一起，他们主要采用信件交流。听取另一个外国科学家作报告，然后公开讨论，这是很稀奇的事件。从19世纪50年代开始，国际会议在火车和蒸汽轮船的帮助下成为可能，这使人们可以和其他国家的同事集会并讨论。他们向世界宣告了一个信仰，科学界的信仰：科学是客观的，国际的，在宗教和政治之上。而宗教和政治经常使人们分裂，让整个国家都处于战争。

The 1860 chemistry gathering met for three days in Karlsruhe, Germany. Many of the leading young chemists from all over Europe came there, including three who would direct chemistry for the rest of the century. The meeting's aims were set by the German August Kekule (1829-96). He wanted chemists from different countries to agree on the words they should use to define the substances they worked with, and the nature of atoms and molecules. A fiery Sicilian chemist, Stanislao Cannizzaro (1826-1910), had already been arguing for this, and he gladly participated. So did a passionate Russian chemist, from Siberia, Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834-1907). The delegates discussed Kekule's suggestions for three days, and while no complete agreement was reached, the seeds had been sown.

1860年的国际化学会议在德国Karlsruhe进行了三天。欧洲许多主要的年轻化学家都来了，包括在剩下的19世纪主导化学的三个人。德国人August Kekule（1829-1896）设定了会议的目标，他希望不同国家的化学家如下事项达成一致意见，包括定义试验用的物质的语言，以及定义原子和分子的性质用的语言。一个热情的西西里化学家，Stanislao Cannizzaro（1826-1910），已经在做这方面的工作了，很高兴的参与了讨论。还有俄罗斯西伯利亚的一位热情的化学家，Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834-1907)。代表们关于Kekule的建议讨论了三天，虽然没有达到完全的一致，但至少种下了种子。

At the meeting, copies of an article published by Cannizzaro in 1858 were given to many of the delegates. Here he reviewed the history of chemistry during the earlier part of the century. He called for chemists to take seriously the work of his fellow countryman Avogadro, who had clearly distinguished between an atom and a molecule. Cannizzaro also argued that it was vital to determine the relative atomic weights of the elements, and he showed how this could be done.

在会议上，Cannizzaro在1858年发表的一篇论文分发给了很多代表，他回顾了本世纪早期的化学发展历史。他的一位同胞Avogadro清楚的区别了在原子和分子，他呼吁化学家们严肃的对待他的工作。Cannizzaro还表示，确定元素原子的相对质量非常重要，并演示了如何实现。

Mendeleev got the message. He owed much to his formidable mother, who had taken this last of her fourteen children from Siberia to St Petersburg, so that Mendeleev could learn about chemistry properly. Like many outstanding chemists of the time, Mendeleev wrote a textbook, based on his own experiments and what he taught his students. Like Cannizzaro, he wanted to bring order into the many elements that had been identified. Patterns had already been revealed: what were called the 'halogen' family - chlorine, bromine and iodine, for instance - reacted in similar ways. They could also be swapped for each other in chemical reactions. Some metals, such as copper and silver, also shared similarities in their reactions. Mendeleev began to list the elements in the order of their relative atomic weight (still using hydrogen as '1'). He presented his ideas in 1869.

Mendeleev同意这些观点。他亏欠他强大的母亲很多，他母亲刚刚把她第14个孩子从西伯利亚带到了St Peterburg，这样Mendeleev可以很好的研究化学。就像很多杰出的化学家一样，Mendeleev写了一本教科书，其基础就是他自己的实验和他教给学生的东西。像Cannizzaro一样，他希望给他识别出的元素排出顺序。已经有了一些模式：比如卤素家族，氯，溴和碘，反应的模式就非常类似。在化学反应中它们也都能替代彼此。有些金属，如铜和银，在化学反应中也有一定相似性。Mendeleev开始以原子相对质量来对元素排序（仍然以氢为1），他在1869年发表了他的想法。

Mendeleev did more than simply compile a list of the elements by atomic weight. He created a table, with rows and columns. You could read it across as well as up and down, and could see the relationship between elements with similar chemical properties. At first, his periodic table, as he came to call it, was very rough, and few chemists paid much attention to it. As he began to fill in the details, something interesting happened: there seemed to be occasional missing elements here and there, substances that his table implied should be there, but which had not been discovered. In fact, there was a whole missing column in his table, predicted by the relative atomic weights. Years later, this column turned out to be filled by non-reactive gases - called the 'noble' gases. Like aristocratic noblemen who don't mix socially with people below them, these gases were aloof from chemical reactions. The main ones were discovered only in the 1890s, and Mendeleev did not accept the findings at first. He soon realized that helium, neon and argon, with the atomic weights that they were shown to possess, had been predicted by his periodic table.

Mendeleev所做的工作比简单的按原子相对质量来编辑元素列表来的要多。他制作了一张表格，有行和列，可以横着读这个表，也可以竖着读这个表，可以看出具有类似化学性质的元素之间的关系。一开始他的周期表（他这样称呼）非常粗糙，极少有化学家关注。当他开始补充细节时，发生了很有趣的事：似乎这儿那儿都有一些缺失的元素，这张表似乎暗示那应该有某种物质，但仍然没有被发现。事实上，根据原子相对质量的预言，有一整列元素都不见了。几年后，这一列元素被不活跃的气体，“高贵”气体，所填补。就像贵族一样，不和低等人社交，这些气体很少有化学反应。其中主要的元素在19世纪90年代发现，一开始Mendeleev并不承认这些发现。他很快根据氦、氖、氩所具有的原子量意识到，这就是他的周期表所预言的元素。

In the 1870s and 1880s, chemists discovered several more of the elements that Mendeleev had predicted on the basis of his table. Many chemists had dismissed as crazy speculation his predictions that the elements eventually called beryllium and gallium must exist. As the gaps he had identified gradually began to be filled, chemists appreciated the power of Mendeleev's table. It was guiding them to discover new elements in nature. It was also explaining what each element is like and how it reacts with other chemicals. What began as Mendeleev's attempt simply to understand the elements produced an amazing key to how nature behaves. The periodic table now hangs in classrooms and chemical laboratories all over the world.

在19世纪80年代和90年代，化学家又发现了几个Mendeleev根据周期表预言的元素。随着周期表预言的元素铍和镓的发现，不赞成的科学家纷纷离去。随着周期表上的空白逐渐的填补，化学家开始重视Mendeleev周期表的力量，它正在引领人们在自然界中发现新元素，还解释了每个元素是怎样的，怎样与其他化学物质反应。一开始是Mendeleev简单的想理解这些元素，后来成为了研究自然界行为的重要钥匙。现在这个周期表悬挂在在全世界的教室和化学实验室中。

For much of the nineteenth century, chemists had been concerned with chemical composition: which atoms and radicals made up specific compounds. The brains behind that first international chemical congress, August Kekule, began to go further. He encouraged scientists to aim to understand chemical structure. Today's chemistry and molecular biology depend on scientists knowing how atoms and molecules are arranged in a substance: where they all sit, and the shapes they form. It would be impossible to search for new drugs without this understanding, and Kekule pioneered it. He told of a dream in which he saw a chain of carbon atoms curled around itself, like a snake biting its own tail. This inspired one of his greatest insights, into benzene, the compound of hydrogen and carbon, which has a closed ring structure. Radicals or elements can be added at various points around the ring, and this was an important advance for organic chemistry.

在19世纪的大部分时间里，化学家都把注意力放在化学成分上，也就是原子和原子团组成的特定化合物上。第一届国际化学大会的主办人，August Kekule，开始研究更多的东西。他鼓励科学家把目标放在理解化学结构上。今天的化学和分子生物学中，科学家理解原子和分子是怎样在物质中组织的，它们形成怎样的形状。如果不是这样，就不可能去发现新药，Kekule最先开始了这项工作。他讲了他的一个梦，梦中他看到一串碳原子首尾相连，就像蛇咬住了自己的尾巴。这给了他理解苯的结构的灵感，苯是碳氢化合物，有着封闭的环形结构。元素或原子团可以在这个环形的很多地方连接，这是有机化学的重要进步。

Dreams are one thing. Doing the hard slog is another. Kekule spent many hours in his laboratory, experimenting. He made sense of organic chemistry - the chemistry of carbon compounds – and taught the whole chemical world how to classify them in their natural families. He was fascinated by carbon's flexibility in joining with other chemicals. Methane gas, then widely used for heat and light, was CH4 - one carbon atom joined to four hydrogen atoms. Two oxygen atoms could combine with a carbon atom, giving CO2 , carbon dioxide. That these atomic preferences were not set in stone was shown by the fact that carbon and oxygen could combine as single atoms to create CO, the deadly gas carbon monoxide.

梦是一回事，艰难探索的道路是另一回事。Kekule在实验室花了很长时间做实验，他赋予有机化学（碳化合物的化学）意义，告诉全世界怎样对有机物按照其自然家族分类。他对碳与其他化学物质结合的灵活能力非常着迷。当时广泛用于加热和照明的甲烷，是CH4，1个碳原子和4个氢原子的结合。2个氧原子可以和1个碳原子结合形成CO2。原子结合的偏好并不是只有一种的，碳和氧也可以单个原子结合，形成CO，非常致命的一氧化碳。

Chemists came up with a word for these joining patterns: valence. And it could be deduced from the position of each element in Mendeleev's periodic table. They speculated about why this was so. Real understanding came only with the discovery, by the physicists, of the inner structure of the atom, and of the electron. The electron linked the chemist's atom with the atom that the physicists were studying, and the next chapter will tell that story.

化学家用一个词来形容结合模式：原子价。这可以通过Mendeleev的周期表中元素位置推断出来。他们思索这是什么。真正理解这个问题要靠物理学家的发现，原子内部的结构和电子的发现。化学家的原子之间的连接，就是物理学家研究的电子，下一章将会讲述这个故事。

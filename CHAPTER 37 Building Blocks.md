# CHAPTER 37 Building Blocks
# 第37章 基础构件

As time went on, scientists tended to specialize in their chosen fields. Still, biologists traditionally did biology, chemists did chemistry and physicists did physics. So what was happening in the 1930s, when first chemists, and then physicists, decided it was time for them to take on the problems of biology? Chemistry was about how substances combine and react. But it was becoming clear that living organisms - the biologists' subject - were made up of some of the elements of the chemists' periodic table, such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Physics was about matter and energy, which by this time was full of atoms and their sub-atomic particles. Wasn't that a way of understanding more about the chemists' elements? To sum up, couldn't chemistry and physics explain living organisms as a series of chemical reactions and atomic structures? And might that provide an answer to one of the oldest questions in science: What is life?

随着科学发展，科学家越来越倾向于在特定的领域有所专长。尽管如此，生物学家传统上做生物学，化学家和物理学家做物理相关的事。那在30年代的时候，当首批化学家，然后物理学家，觉得是时候去解决生物问题了，发生了什么呢？化学是有关物质组合和反应的学科。但活的有机体（生物学家的课题）是由化学元素周期表的某些元素组成的，这一点越来越明了，如碳，氢，氧和氮。物理学是关于物质和能量，那时候是关于原子和亚原子粒子的学科。这不是一种理解化学元素的途径吗？总结起来说，难道物理和化学不能将活的生物体解释成一些列化学反应和物理结构吗？那么这是不是也可以回答科学中最古老的问题之一：生命是什么呢？

In the early decades of the twentieth century, Thomas Hunt Morgan had used his little fruit flies to show that it was the chromosomes in the cell's nucleus that carried the stuff of heredity. 'Stuff' was a good word for it. Geneticists had got very good at showing what this stuff did. They could show how, on different bits of a chromosome, the different genes could result in the development of an eye or a wing. They could even show how mutations produced by X-rays could lead to unusual wing shapes because, they believed, they affected the genes. But they didn't know what a gene was.

二十世纪早期几十年，Thomas Hunt Morgan说明了果蝇是由其细胞核中的染色体携带其遗传“资料”的。“资料”是个很好的词。遗传学家很擅长于解释这些“资料”是什么。他们会展示染色体上不同部分的基因是怎样最后发展形成其眼睛或翅膀的。他们还会展示X射线产生的变异会导致不一样的翅膀形状，因为他们相信这影响了基因。但他们仍不知道基因到底是什么。

Could proteins be this genetic stuff? Proteins are fundamental to many of the reactions that go on inside our bodies. The proteins were the first group of compounds to be systematically studied by molecular biologists. As the name suggests, molecular biology is a science that seeks to understand the chemistry of the molecules in living things, and how they work. Proteins are mostly very large, complex molecules. They are composed of groups of amino acids, which are smaller and simpler compounds than proteins. Being simpler, it was easier to find out what the amino acids were made of, using ordinary chemical analysis and synthesis. About twenty amino acids are the building-blocks that in different combinations make up all of the proteins in plants and animals.

蛋白质是基因物质吗？蛋白质是我们体内很多反应的基础。蛋白质是系统的被分子生物学家研究的第一类化合物。正如名字那样，分子生物学是研究活体细胞核的化学性质和工作原理的学科。蛋白质通常都是比较大的、复杂的细胞核。它们是由不同类别的氨基酸组成的，氨基酸是比蛋白质更小、更简单的化合物。因为简单，所以更容易用常规化学的合成与分析的方法来分析氨基酸是由什么构成的。动植物体内的蛋白质是由约二十种氨基酸作为基础构件根据不同组合形成的。

How these amino acids fit together to make the proteins was a much more difficult question. This was where physics began to play a part - it turned out that X-rays provided clues. The first thing was to make a crystal of the protein you wanted to study. Next, you bombarded the crystal with X-rays. As the X-rays hit the crystal they would be bent as they passed through it, or would be reflected back in a particular pattern, known as the diffraction pattern. It could be caught on a photographic plate.

这些氨基酸怎样组合形成蛋白质是个复杂的多的难题。这里物理学就派上用场了 – X射线可以提供线索。首先将要研究的蛋白质做成晶体，然后用X射线轰击晶体。当X射线击中晶体时，会折射通过晶体，或反射回来形成衍射模式，这可以在摄影底片上捕捉到。

Reading the patterns captured on the photographic plate is a tricky business. What you see is an intricate picture of lots and lots of dots and shadows. You are looking at a flat, two-dimensional image but you have to think in three dimensions, and just putting on 3D glasses won't help. As well as being able to visualize the picture, you also need to know your chemistry and understand how elements join together. And be good at maths too. Someone who took on this challenge was the chemist Dorothy Hodgkin (1910-94) who worked at Oxford University. We partly owe what we know about the structure of penicillin, Vitamin B12 and insulin to her research in X-ray crystallography. She won her Nobel Prize in 1964.

理解摄影底片上捕捉到的模式是需要复杂的技巧。在这个复杂的图像上看到的是很多很多的点和阴影。我们看到的是一幅平面的二维图像但必须在三维空间中想象，戴上3D眼睛是没啥用的。除了将其可视化外，还需要知道相关的化学知识以及理解元素怎么结合成化合物的，数学知识也需要很好。牛津大学的Dorothy Hodgkin(1910-94)接受了这项挑战。盘尼西林、维生素B12和胰岛素结构的发现都应部分归功于她在X射线晶体学方面的研究。她在1964年获得了诺贝尔奖。

Linus Pauling (1901-94) was also good at using X-rays to work out the structure of complex chemical compounds. In a brilliant series of experiments, he and his colleagues were able to show that if just one amino acid was missing from the hemoglobin molecule in our red blood cells, it produced a serious disease: sickle-cell anemia. (Rather than being round, the red blood cells that contain this hemoglobin are shaped like a sickle.) This molecular flaw is found mostly in Africa, where malaria is always present. It is now understood to benefit the people who have the flaw, because the sickle cells help to protect against the most serious form of malaria. This is an example of human evolution in action. People with only the trait (a single gene, inherited in the way Mendel first studied in peas) are moderately anemic, but they are more resistant to malaria. Individuals who inherit the sickle-cell gene from both parents are seriously ill from anemia. The symptoms of sickle-cell anemia had been identified early in the twentieth century. Fifty years later, Pauling used the new techniques of molecular biology to understand what was going on, and his research began a new era in medicine: molecular medicine.

Linus Pauling（1901-94）也很擅长通过X射线来研究复杂化合物的结构。在一些列著名的实验中，他和同事发现即使红血细胞中的血红蛋白细胞核仅有一种氨基酸缺失，也会引起一些列疾病：镰状红细胞贫血症（含有这种血红蛋白细胞核的红细胞其形状是镰刀形的，而不是圆形的）。这种细胞核缺陷通常发现在非洲，那里经常有疟疾。现在我们知道了这种缺陷对当地人是有益的，因为这种镰状细胞可以帮助抵御最严重的疟疾。这是一个人类进化的例子。只有这种性状（单一基因，孟德尔初次研究豌豆时用的词）的人会有普通的贫血症，但对疟疾有很高的抵抗力。如果双亲都有镰状红细胞基因，且都遗传给了孩子，那么孩子会有很严重的贫血症。镰状红细胞贫血症的现象最初在20世纪早期发现。50年后，Pauling采用分子生物学的新技术分析理解了其原理，他的研究开启了医药学的新领域：分子医药学。

After his success with proteins, Pauling almost achieved the biggest prize: revealing the molecular structure of the genes. His X-ray experiments showed that many proteins, such as those that make your hair and muscles, or carry your oxygen on the hemoglobin molecules, have a special shape. They were often wound into a spiral (helix). By the early 1950s, lots of scientists thought that the genes were made up of deoxyribonucleic acid. This compound is much better known as DNA, and a lot easier to say. DNA had been discovered in 1869 but it took a long time to understand what it might do and what it looked like. In 1952 Pauling suggested that it was a long coiled molecule made up of three strands twisted together - what was called a triple helix.

在成功的研究了蛋白质后，Pauling几乎得到了最高奖赏：揭示了基因的分子结构。他的X射线实验说明很多蛋白质，比如组成你的头发和肌肉的，或在红细胞核中携带氧气的，都有一种特殊的形状。它们经常卷绕成一个螺旋形状。在50年代早期，多数科学家认为基因是由脱氧核糖核酸组成的。这种化合物通常被叫做DNA。DNA在1869年发现，但过了很长时间才理解了DNA能干什么，DNA是什么样子。1952年Pauling提出DNA是由3条线扭在一起的绕长圈的分子，现在被称作三重螺旋结构。

While Pauling was at work in California, two groups in England were hard on his heels. At King's College, London, the physicist Maurice Wilkins (1916-2004) and the chemist Rosalind Franklin (1920- 58) were turning themselves into molecular biologists. Franklin was particularly good at producing and reading the photographs produced by X-ray crystallography. At Cambridge, a young American, James Watson (b. 1928), had given up his earlier interest in ornithology(the study of birds) and teamed up with Francis Crick (1916-2004). Crick had studied physics, and after working as a physicist for the Admiralty during the Second World War, he had gone back to university as a mature student, this time to study biology. Watson and Crick would become one of the most famous double acts in science.

当Pauling在California工作时，英国两个小组也在紧跟着他的研究。在伦敦的国王学院，物理学家Maurice Wilkins(1916-2004)和化学家Rosalind Franklin(1920-58)转向了分子生物学研究。Franklin很善于X射线晶体学。在剑桥，一个美国年轻人，James Watson(b.1928)，放弃了他早期关于鸟类的研究，与Francis Crick（1916-2004）组成了团队。Crick研究过物理学，在二战中为海军部作为物理学家工作过后，作为一个成年学生回到了大学，开始学习生物学。Watson和Crick后面成为了科学界非常著名的双人组合。

Crick shared his experience on the X-ray analysis of the structure of proteins. He and Watson knew that DNA is found on the chromosomes in the cell nucleus - the same cell components that Morgan had analyzed thirty years before. They made paper cut-outs and built models to help them see possible structures of DNA. They also benefited from the photographs that Franklin had produced. Early in 1953 they created a new model that matched all the X-ray data. This one, they said, was the right one. Celebrating in the pub that night, the story goes that they claimed they had discovered ‘the secret of life’.

Crick分享了X射线分析蛋白质结构的经验。他和Watson知道细胞核中的染色体上发现了DNA，Morgan30年前就分析了同样的细胞组成部分。他们建立模型以帮助研究DNA的可能结构。他们也从Franklin得到的图像中获得启发。早在1953年他们创造了一个新的模型匹配上了所有的X射线数据。他们说这个模型就是对的了。在酒吧庆祝的当晚，他们宣布他们发现了“生命的奥秘”。

If the other drinkers that night were a bit in the dark, wondering what they meant, readers of the weekly scientific magazine Nature would soon find out. Crick and Watson published their findings in the issue of 25 April 1953, which also included a paper by the London team of Wilkins and Franklin. But it was Crick and Watson who showed that DNA is made of two twisted strands, not three as Pauling had said. The strands were joined together by cross-pieces - so that it looked like a long flexible ladder twisted into a spiral. The uprights on the ladder are a kind of sugar – the D or deoxyribo part of the molecule and phosphates. Each rung of the ladder is made of a pair of molecules: either adenine with thymine, or cytosine with guanine. These became known as the 'base pairs' of molecules. So if that was the structure, how did it explain 'the secret of life'?

如果还有些喝酒的人那天在稍暗的地方，纳闷他们说的什么意思，那么科学周刊自然的读者很快就会发现了。Crick和Watson在1953年4月25日的期刊上刊登了他们的发现，那一期上还有伦敦的Wilkins和Franklin小组的一篇文章。但确实是Crick和Watson表明DNA是双螺旋结构的，而不是Pauling说的三螺旋结构。两个片段有中间的连接部分，这样就像一个柔性的梯子扭曲成了螺旋形状。梯子竖直的部分是一种糖，也就是分子的脱氧核糖部分和磷酸盐。梯子的每个横档是由一对分子组成的：或者是adenine和thymine，或者是cytosine和guanine。后来被称为分子的碱基对。那么如果这就是其结构的话，这怎么解释“生命的奥秘”呢？

The base pairs are joined together by hydrogen bonds. When cells divide, the coils unwind, almost as if they are ‘unzipping’. The two halves now present the templates for two identical chains to be made by the cell. So Watson and Crick had shown how genes could be passed from parent to offspring and how 'daughter' cells would contain the same set of genes as the original 'mother' cell. It was simple and elegant, and it immediately seemed obvious. In 1962, when the scientific community had fully accepted the structure and role of DNA, Crick, Watson and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize. Only three people can officially share a Nobel Prize. But Rosalind Franklin was not ignored: she had died of ovarian cancer, aged only thirty-eight, in 1958.

碱基对由氢键连在一起。当细胞分裂时，螺旋解开，就像拉开拉链一样。这两个半边分别提供了产生两个相同链式结构的模板，以组成细胞。这样Crick和Watson就展示了基因是如何从父辈传到后代，子细胞如何与母细胞拥有相同的基因的。简单而又优雅，这种理论立刻就变得显而易见。1962年，当科学界完全接纳了DNA的结构时，Crick, Watson和Wilkins分享了那一年的诺贝尔奖。只有3个人分享了诺贝尔奖，但Rosalind Franklin并不是被遗忘了，她在38岁时也就是1958年因为卵巢癌去世了。

Francis Crick went on, with others, to explain why genes are so important for living organisms, besides their role in inheritance. What genes do in their daily activity is make proteins. The 'genetic code' is made up of three neighboring rungs on the ladder, and each triplet of rungs (the 'codon') is responsible for a single amino acid. Crick showed how little portions of the DNA molecule provide the codes for the amino acids that make up proteins such as hemoglobin and insulin. Geneticists realized that the order of the base pairs within the DNA molecule is crucial, because that determines which amino acids will be built into the proteins. Proteins are very complex molecules, sometimes with dozens of amino acids, so a long sequence of DNA is necessary to make such a protein.

Francis Crick继续与其他人一起研究解释为什么基因除了含有遗传信息外对于活的生物体那么重要。基因的日常活动是制作蛋白质。每个基因序列是由3个临近的连接横档构成的，每个这样的三连组（codon）都对应一个氨基酸。Crick展示了DNA的一点些许片段是如何提供氨基酸的基因信息的，这些片段可以制造像血红蛋白或者胰岛素这样的蛋白质。基因学家意识到DNA分子中的碱基对排序至关重要，因为它确定了蛋白质中包含哪些氨基酸。蛋白质是非常复杂的分子，有时候含有数十种氨基酸，所以制作这样的蛋白质需要一个很长序列的DNA。

With the basic workings of DNA understood, scientists could now make sense of the kinds of thing that Morgan had seen in his fly room. Morgan had been looking at the visible characteristics of whole organisms - in his case, the fly with its normal white eye or mutant red eye. This kind of visible trait is called a phenotype. From now on, scientists could begin to work at a level below the whole organism, at the level of the genes - what now became known as the genotype.

确定了DNA的基本工作原理后，科学家们现在可以解释Morgan在他的果蝇房间看到的那些现象了。Morgan一直在观察整个有机体的那些可见的特征，比如有正常白色眼睛的果蝇或者变异的红色眼睛的国营。这种可见的性状称之为显性性状。从这以后，科学家们可以在整个有机体的低一层次，也就是基因的层级工作，现在我们称之为基因型。

Discovering the structure of DNA was a huge turning point in the history of modern biology. It showed that biologists could understand things in terms of the molecules in the cells, previously the domain of chemists. This was now what everyone wanted to do. Later research revealed that the amino acids and then the proteins were made in the cell's cytoplasm - the liquid bit outside the nucleus. Learning how this little protein factory worked included the discovery of RNA. This is ribonucleic acid, similar to DNA, but with only one strand, not two, and a different kind of sugar. The RNA had an important part to play in the flow of information from the DNA in the nucleus of the cell to the protein factory in the cytoplasm.

历史上，发现DNA的结构是现代生物学的巨大转折点。这说明生物学家可以以细胞中的分子来理解事物，这在以前是化学的范畴。现在每个人都想做这项工作。后续研究表明，氨基酸和蛋白质是在细胞的细胞质中制造出来的，细胞质是细胞核外的液体部分。在发现这个小小的蛋白质工厂怎么工作的过程中，发现了RNA，也就是核糖核酸，和DNA类似，但是只有一条线段，而不是两条，所含糖的种类也不一样。在细胞核中的DNA将信息传到细胞质中的蛋白质工厂的过程中，RNA发挥了重要的作用。

Molecular biologists were to transform our knowledge of how diseases originate. They uncovered how proteins like the hormone insulin did their job in regulating blood sugar. They gained a better understanding of cancer, one of our most feared modern diseases. Although all cancers can overwhelm the whole body, and thus become a general disease, they start with a single mutated cell, which misbehaves and doesn't stop dividing when it ought to. These runaway cells are greedy. They use up the body's nutrients, and if they spread to a vital organ, the cancer cells disrupt its functions, leading to further illness. Finding out how this happens at the molecular level was essential before better drugs could be developed to slow the process down, or even stop it.

分子生物学家将要改变我们对于疾病是如何发生的知识。他们发现了像荷尔蒙胰岛素这样的蛋白质在调节我们的血糖时是如何发挥作用的。对于癌症这一最令人恐惧的现代病症，也有了更深入的了解。尽管所有癌症都会扩散到整个身体，从而变成一个全身疾病，但它仍然是从一个变异的细胞开始的，这个细胞行为异常，在该停止分裂的时候却继续分裂。这些失控的细胞非常贪婪。它们耗尽人体养分，而且如果扩散到关键器官，癌细胞会破坏其发挥正常功能，导致进一步发病。寻找分子层级到底发生了什么是非常重要的，可以研制出更好的药来减缓这一过程，或者停止这个过程。

Studying these dynamic processes is difficult in large, complicated animals like humans, so much of the work of molecular biologists depends on using simpler organisms. A lot of the early research on the actual functions of DNA and RNA was done with bacteria, and cancer research uses animals such as mice. Translating these findings to human beings isn't easy, but that is the way modern science operates: going from the simpler to the more complex. This method has helped us understand the processes that have driven evolution for millions of years. It turns out that DNA is the molecule that controls our destinies.

研究这种动态过程总体上来说是非常困难的，尤其对于复杂的动物如人类，分子生物学家的很多工作都是依靠简单的微生物。早期关于DNA和RNA的功能的实验都是对细菌做的，癌症研究对象像是小白鼠。将这些科研结果移植到人类身上并不容易，但这就是现代科学发展的方式：从简单到复杂。这种方法可以帮助理解在几百万年间驱动进化的这个过程。结果发现DNA才是控制我们命运的分子。

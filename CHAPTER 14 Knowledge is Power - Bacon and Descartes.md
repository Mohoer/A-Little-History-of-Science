# CHAPTER 14 Knowledge is Power - Bacon and Descartes
# 第14章 知识就是力量 – 培根和笛卡尔

In the century between Copernicus and Galileo, science had turned the world upside down. The earth was no longer at the centre of the universe, and new discoveries in anatomy, physiology, chemistry and physics reminded people that the Ancients did not know everything after all. There was a lot out there still to be discovered.

哥白尼和伽利略之间的这个世纪，科学已经使世界天翻地覆。地球已经不是宇宙的中心，解剖学、生理学、化学和物理中的新发现提醒着人们古人毕竟不是知道所有事的，仍然有很多有待发现。

People also started thinking about science itself. What was the best way to do it? How could we be sure that new discoveries were accurate? And how could we use science to improve our comfort, health and happiness? Two individuals in particular thought deeply about science: one an English lawyer and politician, the other a French philosopher.

人们也开始思考科学本身。怎样是研究科学最好的方法？怎么才能确认新发现是精确的？怎样利用科学来改进生活舒适度、健康和幸福程度？有两个特别的人对科学进行了深入思考：一个英国律师和政治家，另一个是法国哲学家。

The Englishman was Francis Bacon (1561-1626). His father, Nicholas Bacon, rose from humble beginnings to become a powerful official for Queen Elizabeth I. Nicholas knew how important education is, so he sent his son to the University of Cambridge. Francis, too, served Elizabeth, as well as King James I, after Elizabeth died. He was an expert on English law, took part in several important trials and, after he became Lord Chancellor, was one of the major legal figures of his time. He was also active as a member of parliament.

这个英国人是弗朗西斯•培根（1561-1626）。他的父亲，尼古拉斯•培根，从下层成为了伊利莎白一世的有权势的官员。尼古拉斯知道教育的重要性，所以将他儿子送去了剑桥大学。弗朗西斯也在伊利莎白手下服务，女王去世后在詹姆斯一世手下服务。他是一位英国法律的专家，参加了几次重要的审判，后来成为上议院大法官，是那个时代主要的法律人物之一，他还是议会的积极成员之一。

Bacon was very enthusiastic about science. He spent a lot of time doing chemistry experiments and observing all kinds of curious things in nature, from plants and animals to weather and magnetism. More important than any discovery he made were his elegant and persuasive arguments about why science was worth doing, and how it should be done. Bacon urged people to value science. ‘Knowledge is power’, he famously said, and science is the best way to achieve that knowledge. So he encouraged Elizabeth and James to use public money to build laboratories and provide places for scientists to do their work. Scientists, he thought, should form societies, or academies, so they could meet and exchange their ideas and observations. Science, he said, offers humans the means to understand nature, and, by understanding, to be able to control her.

培根对科学很热心，他花了很多时间在化学实验和观察各种自然中古怪的事情上，从植物到动物到天气和磁性。比所有发现更重要的是他关于科学为什么值得去研究、怎样去研究的优雅而有说服力的说理。培根敦促人们珍爱科学。他曾经说过著名的“知识就是力量”，而科学就是获得知识的最好途径。所以他鼓励伊利莎白和詹姆斯用公共资产来建造实验室，为科学家工作提供场所。他认为科学应当成立协会，或学会，这样可以集会、交换意见和观测结果。他说，科学提供了理解自然的方法，通过理解，就可以控制自然。

Bacon wrote clearly about the best way for science to advance. Scientists needed to make sure that the words they used were precise and easily understood by others. They needed to approach their investigations with open minds, instead of trying to prove what they thought they already knew. Above all, they must repeat their experiments and observations, so that they can be certain of their results. This is the method of induction. For example, by counting, weighing or mixing chemicals again and again, the chemist can become properly confident about what is going on. As scientists collect more and more observations, or inductions, they will become surer about what will happen. They can use these inductions to form generalizations, which in turn will show them the laws governing how nature works. Bacon's ideas continued to inspire scientists for many generations. They still do so today.

培根清楚了写下了发展科学最好的方法，科学家需要确认他们使用的词语是精确的，而且别人容易理解，他们需要以开放的心态进行调查研究，而不是努力去证明那些已经知道的已经想到的。他们尤其要注意的是，要重复进行他们的实验和观察，以对结果更加确定。这是归纳的方法。比如，通过一遍又一遍的计数、称重或混合化学物质，化学家会对正在进行的东西有合理的信心。当科学家的观测结果或归纳结论越来越多，对将要发生的事就会越来越有信心。他们可以用归纳结论来形成一般化结论，这样就可以得出掌管自然工作的规律。培根的观点持续启示了很多代科学家，今天仍然是这样。

So, in different ways, did those of the Frenchman Rene Descartes (1596-1650). He thought deeply about the work of both Harvey and Galileo. Like Galileo, Descartes was a Catholic who nevertheless passionately believed that religion should not come into the study of the natural world. Like Harvey, Descartes examined human and animal bodies and explained how they worked in ways that went far beyond what Galen had taught. In fact, even more than either Harvey or Galileo, Descartes tried to establish both science and philosophy on entirely new foundations. Although today we remember him mostly as a philosopher, he was much more of a practicing scientist than Bacon.

法国人Rene Descartes (1596-1650)也以不同的方式做了这些事情。他深入思考了Harvey和伽利略的工作。笛卡尔和伽利略一样是个罗马天主教徒，不过坚信宗教不要介入自然世界的研究中。和Harvey一样，笛卡尔检查了人类和动物的身体，解释了身体工作的方式与盖伦教授的很不一样。实际上，笛卡尔尝试将科学与哲学建立在全新的基础上，这比Harvey或伽利略要走的要远。虽然今天我们主要认为他是个哲学家，但他比培根还要是一个实践科学家。

Descartes was born in La Haye, in Touraine, France. A clever boy, he went to a famous school, La Fleche, in the Loire region, where excellent French wines are made. At La Fleche, he learned of Galileo's discoveries with his telescope, Copernicus's placing the sun at the centre of the universe, and the latest mathematics. He graduated in law at the University of Poitiers, and then he did a very surprising thing: he volunteered for an army of Protestants. War raged in Europe during the whole of Descartes' adult life (the Thirty Years War), and for almost nine years, he was part of it. Descartes never actually fought, although his knowledge of practical mathematics, and where cannon-balls might land, could have helped the soldiers. He was attached to both Protestant and Catholic armies during these years, and seemed always to be where important political or military events were taking place. We don't know what he was doing, or how he got the money to travel so much. Perhaps he was a spy. If so, it was probably for the Catholics, to whom he always remained loyal.

笛卡尔生于法国Touraine的La Haye。他是个聪明的孩子，去了一所非常有名的学校，在Loire地区的La Fleche，是个产法国好酒的地方。在La Fleche，他知道了伽利略利用望远镜的发现，哥白尼将太阳放在了宇宙的中心，以及最新的数学知识。他以法学毕业于Poitiers大学，然后做了一件让人吃惊的事：他自愿进入了新教的军队。笛卡尔整个成年时期，欧洲都在打仗（三十年战争），他有几乎九年时间都在参与这场战争。笛卡尔没有真正的在打仗，虽然他实用数学的知识，比如计算加农炮弹在哪里落地，可以帮助士兵。这些年他与新教军队和天主教军队都有联系，而且总在重要的政治或军事事件发生的地方出现。我们不知道他在做什么，也不知道他怎么有钱到处旅游。可能他是一个间谍，如果这样的话，很可能是为了罗马教廷，他一直忠于教廷。

Early in his adventures, on 10 November 1619, in a warm, stove-lit room, half asleep, half awake, he came to two conclusions. First, if he were ever to come to true knowledge, he had to do it all himself. The teachings of Aristotle and other authorities would not do. He needed to start over. Second, he concluded that the only way to start over was simply by doubting everything! Later that night, he had three dreams that he understood as encouraging this idea. He didn't publish anything then, and in any case, his military adventures had just begun. But this decisive day (and night) started him on his path to explain the universe and everything in it, as well as the rules that might help others obtain scientific knowledge with confidence.

在他早期的探险中，在1619年11月10日，在一个温暖的生着炉火的房间里，半睡半醒，他得出了两个结论。第一，如果想得到任何真的知识，他必须自己做所有的事。亚里士多德和其他权威的说教并不能算，他需要重新开始。第二，唯一重新开始的方法就是怀疑一切！那天晚上晚一些时候，他做了三个梦，他理解为鼓励他的这些想法。那时他没有发表任何东西，无论如何他的军事冒险才刚刚开始。但这具有决定性意义的一天（一夜）开启了他解释宇宙和其中所有事物的道路，还有那些帮助其他人自信的获得科学知识的规则。

Doubting everything meant taking nothing for granted, and then, bit by bit, following your nose by accepting only things you can be sure about. But what could he be sure about? In the first instance, only one thing: that he was planning this scientific and philosophical project. He was thinking about how to arrive at certain knowledge, but, more simply, he was thinking. ‘Cogito, ergo sum’, he wrote in Latin: ‘I think, therefore, I am.’ I exist because I am thinking these thoughts.

怀疑所有事物意味着对所有事物都不会认为理所当然，然后一点点的，接受那些你可以确定的事情。但他可以确定什么呢？在第一个例子中，只有一件事：就是他正为这个科学和哲学工程做准备。他正思考怎样得到特定的知识，但更简单的是，他正在思考。他用拉丁文写到，“Cogito, ergo sum”，就是“我思故我在”。我存在的原因就是我再思考那些思想。

This simple statement was Descartes' starting-point. That is all well and good, we might say, but what next? For Descartes, it had one immediate and far-reaching consequence: I exist because I am thinking, but I can imagine that I could think without having a body. However, if I had a body and couldn't think, I wouldn't know it. Therefore, my body and the thinking part (my mind, or soul) must be separate and distinct. This was the basis of dualism, the notion that the universe is made up of two completely different kinds of things: matter (for instance, human bodies, but also chairs, stones, planets, cats and dogs) and spirit (the human soul or mind). Descartes thus insisted that our minds - how we know we exist - have a very special place in the universe.

这句话是笛卡尔思想的起点。这都很好，但下一步呢？对笛卡尔来说，有一个直接而又深远的结果：我存在因为我在思考，但我可以想象没有身体在思考。但如果我有身体但不思考，我就不会知道。所以，我的身体和思考的部分（理智，灵魂）必须清楚的分开。这是二元论的基础，也就是宇宙由两大不同种类的东西组成的观点：物质（比如，人体，还有椅子，石头，行星，猫和狗）和精神（人的灵魂或理智）。因此笛卡尔坚持认为我们的理智（我们怎么知道我们存在）在宇宙中有独特的地位。

Now, people before and long after Descartes recognized that human beings are a special kind of animal. We have the ability to do things that no other animal has: to read and write, to make sense of the complexities of the world, to build jet planes and atomic bombs. Specialness was not the unusual part of Descartes' separation of our minds and our bodies. The amazing step was what he did with the rest of the world, the material part. Mind and matter are what the world is made up of, he said, and matter is the subject of science. This means that the material, non-thinking, parts of how we function can be understood in simple physical terms. And it means that all plants and all other animals, none of which have a soul, can also be completely reduced to matter doing its stuff. Along with trees and flowers, the fish and elephants are nothing but more or less complicated machines. According to Descartes, they are things that can be completely understood.

笛卡尔之前以及之后的人都承认人类是一种特殊的动物。我们有其他动物没有的能力：阅读和写作，让复杂的世界有意义，建造喷气式飞机和原子弹。特殊性是笛卡尔分离理智与身体的寻常部分。他对剩余的世界，即物质部分所作的才是令人吃惊的一步。他说，理智与物质构成这个世界，物质是科学的主题。这意思是说物质，非思想部分，我们身体各部分如何发挥作用，是可以用简单的物理术语解释的；这也意味着所有的行星和动物，它们都没有灵魂，都可以完全简化成物质运动的解释。还有树木、花朵、鱼类、大象都是复杂程度不同的机器。根据笛卡尔的思想，它们都是可以完全被理解的东西。

Descartes knew about automata, mechanical lifelike figures specially made to move and do certain things. We would call them robots. For example, a lot of seventeenth-century town clocks had little mechanical figures, often a man coming out on the hour to strike a gong. They were all the rage in Descartes' day (and some still work now). People had already wondered if- since human beings could make such delicate figures, able to move and imitate humans or animals - perhaps a better mechanic could go one step further and make a dog that could eat and bark, as well as move. Descartes had no desire to make these toys, but in his thinking, plants and animals were just extremely complicated automata, with no real feelings and only the capacity to respond to what was happening around them. These machines were matter, which could be understood by scientists in terms of mechanical and chemical principles. Descartes read William Harvey's work on the 'mechanical' actions of the heart and the circulation of the blood, and he believed that this provided evidence for his system. (His own explanation of what goes on when the blood reaches the heart, and why it circulates, has been forgotten.) Descartes had great hopes that such ideas could explain much about health and disease, and ultimately offer human beings the knowledge of how to live, if not forever, at least for a very long time.

笛卡尔知道自动装置，类似生命的机械物，通过特殊设计进行运动或做特定的事，可以称之为机器人。比如，很多17世纪的镇钟包含小的机械角色，通常是一个小人出来在整点时敲一下锣。这是笛卡尔时代流行的事物（现在仍然有一些可以工作）。人们已经想知道，人类可以造出如此精致的角色，可以动，可以模仿人类或动物，那么是不是有更好的技师可以更进一步，做出一只狗，可以吃，可以叫，还可以动呢？笛卡尔没有兴趣去做这些玩具，但在他的思想中，动物和植物只是非常复杂的自动装置，没有什么真实的想法，只能对周围发生的事做出反应。这些机器是物质，是科学家可以以机械和化学原则理解的。笛卡尔读了William Harvey的著作中关于心脏和血液循环中的“机械”动作，他相信这为他的体系提供了证据（他自己关于血液到达心脏时的解释，为什么血液会循环，已经被遗忘）。笛卡尔非常希望这些观点可以解释健康和疾病，最终为人类提供怎样生活的知识，即使不是永远，也可以持续很长时间。

Having shown to his satisfaction that the universe is composed of two separate kinds of thing, matter and mind, Descartes puzzled how the human mind and its body were actually connected. He asked himself how they could be connected, if matter has substance and occupies space, and mind is the opposite, located nowhere and without any material basis at all. It had been common since the time of Hippocrates to associate our thinking powers with the brain. A blow to the head could knock a person out, and many medical men had observed that injuries and diseases of the brain led to changes in our mental functions. At one point, Descartes seemed to think that the human soul is located in a gland, in the middle of our brains, but he knew that, according to the logic of the system he had created, matter and mind could never physically interact. People later called this model of human beings ‘the ghost in the machine’, meaning that our machine-like bodies were somehow driven by a ghost-like mind, or soul. The problem then was to explain how many dogs, chimpanzees, horses and other animals share so many of our mental capacities without having their own ‘ghosts’. Dogs and cats can show fear or anger, and dogs at least seem to be able to express love for their owners. (Cats are a law unto themselves.)

宇宙是由物质和理智两种东西组成的，这个观点让他很满意，但笛卡尔对人的理智与身体如何结合的感到困惑。他自问它们是如何结合的，如果物质有具体形态、占据一定的空间，而理智则是相反的，并没有在哪个具体地方，而且完全没有物质基础。自从希波克拉底时代，就已经将思想与大脑联系起来了。对脑袋的打击可以将人击倒，很多医生发现大脑受到的伤害会导致精神性功能的变化。笛卡尔曾一度认为灵魂在大脑中的某个腺体中，但他知道，根据他创造的体系的逻辑，物质与理智是不会有物理接触的。后世的人们称这种人类的模型为“机器中的幽灵”，意思是我们身体就像机器，但是由幽灵般的理智或灵魂驱动的。现在问题就是，如何解释这么多狗、大猩猩、马和其他动物都和我们一样都有心智能力但没有自己的“幽灵”。狗和猫会表现出害怕或愤怒，而且狗至少似乎能表现对主人的爱（而猫是很自我的动物）。

Descartes' curious mind puzzled over many other things: not surprising for someone who wrote a book called simply Le Monde ('The World'). He accepted Copernicus's ideas about the relationship between the earth and the sun, but was more careful than Galileo had been in presenting his ideas so that he did not offend the Church authorities. He also wrote about motion, falling objects, and other problems that attracted Galileo. Unfortunately, despite having some followers in his day, Descartes' ideas about how the universe works could not compete with those of giants like Galileo and Isaac Newton, and few remember Descartes' physics today.

笛卡尔对很多其他事情都有好奇心和困惑，这对于一本写过书《世界》的人来说并不奇怪。他接受哥白尼关于地球和太阳关系的思想，但比伽利略在表达思想方面更加小心，这样就不会侵犯到教廷的权威。他在运动、自由落体和其他吸引伽利略的主题上都有著作。不幸的是，尽管在当时有一些追随者，但笛卡尔关于宇宙运行的思想无法与像伽利略或牛顿这样的思想巨人相比，所以今天很少有人记得笛卡尔的物理贡献。

If he lost out to clever men in the physics class, whether you know it or not, you follow in Descartes' footsteps every time you solve problems in algebra and geometry. Descartes had the bright idea of using a, b, c in algebra problems to stand for the known, and x, y, z to stand for the unknown. So when you are asked to solve an equation such as x =a+b2, you are continuing the practice that Descartes started. And when you plot something on a graph, with a horizontal and a vertical axis, you are also using his invention. Descartes himself solved various algebraic and geometric problems in his book on those subjects, published along with the one on the world.

如果你在物理课上输给了聪明的人，不论你是不是知道，你在解决问题时用到的代数或几何知识，都来自笛卡尔。笛卡尔聪明的用a,b,c代表已知数，用x,y,z代表未知数。所以当要求你解类似x=a+b2这样的方程，你就正在继续笛卡尔开始做的事。当你开始在有水平和竖直轴的图上画什么东西，你也在使用他的发明。笛卡尔在他的书中解决了各种代数和几何问题，并一同与其他主题出版。

By so sharply separating body and mind, the material and the mental worlds, Descartes stressed how important the material world is for science. Astronomy, physics and chemistry deal with matter. So does biology, and if his idea of the animal-machine seems a bit far-fetched, biologists and doctors still try to understand how plants and animals function in terms of their material parts. It was just unfortunate for Descartes that his idea that medicine would quickly show people how to live for much longer was a bit before its time. He himself was pretty healthy until he accepted an invitation to go to Sweden to teach the Swedish queen his philosophy and knowledge of the world. She rose early and insisted that he give her the lessons very early in the morning. Descartes hated the cold. He did not survive even his first winter in Sweden. Catching some kind of infection, he died in February 1650, seven weeks before his fifty-fourth birthday. It was a sad end for someone who believed that he would live at least a hundred years.

笛卡尔分离了身体与理智，物质和精神世界，并强调物质世界对科学的重要性。解剖学、物理和化学都是与物质相关的，还有生物学，如果他的动物-机器观点有点牵强附会，生物学家和医生仍然在尝试用物质部分来理解动植物是如何发挥功能的。对笛卡尔来说非常不幸的是，他认为医学很快就会让人知道怎样活的更久，这似乎有点太过超前了。他在受邀到瑞典为女王教授哲学和世界知识前，一直都非常健康。女王起床很早，坚持要求笛卡尔在早上很早就给他讲课。笛卡尔不习惯那种寒冷，在瑞典的第一个冬天就去世了，得了某些感染，在1650年2月去世的，离他的54岁生日还有7个星期。对于一个认为自己至少会活100岁的人来说，这非常令人难过。

Bacon and Descartes had lofty ideals for science. They differed in their ideas about how science could advance, but were passionate that it should. Bacon's vision was of science as a shared, state-funded enterprise. Descartes was more content to work things out by himself. Both wanted other people to take on and develop their ideas. Both men also believed that science is a special activity, superior to the humdrum of ordinary life. It deserved to be singled out in this way because science adds to our stock of knowledge and our ability to understand nature. Such understanding could improve our lives and the public good.

培根和笛卡尔对科学有着崇高的理想。他们关于科学怎样发展有一些不同意见，但都热心于其应当发展。培根认为科学应当是一种共享的，国家资助的事业。笛卡尔更认为应当独自进行研究。两个人都希望别人继续发展他们的思想，也都相信科学是一种特殊的活动，胜于单调的日常生活。值得这样单独提出来，是因为科学增加了我们的知识储备，增加了我们理解自然的能力。这种理解可以改进我们的生活和公共利益。

# CHAPTER 36 Wonder Drugs
# 第36章 奇迹药物

There may be five million trillion trillion bacteria on earth. That's 5×1030 or 5 with thirty noughts after it - an astounding number. Bacteria can live almost anywhere on earth: in the soil, the oceans, deep underground on rocks, in Arctic ice, in the boiling water of geysers, on our skin and inside our bodies. Bacteria do all sorts of useful things - without them what would happen to all the rubbish they digest? We benefit from that digesting trick too. The bacteria that live in our guts help us break down the food we eat to release the proteins and vitamins. Some bacteria even turned out to make useful drugs, along with some other micro-organisms, the fungi. Most of us have been prescribed some of these antibiotics.

地球上可能有五百万亿亿亿个细菌。这是5×1030或者5后面跟30个0，这是令人震惊的数字。细菌可以存活在地球上的任何地方：土壤中，大海里，岩石下面深处，北极冰雪中，烧水锅炉里的沸水中，在我们体表，和体内。细菌会做各种有益的事情，如果没有了它们那么多垃圾怎么消化？这个消化技巧也使我们收益。我们肠道里的细菌帮助我们分解食物，释放出蛋白质和维生素。有些细菌和其他微生物、菌类一起甚至可以制成很有用的药物。我们大多数人都开过这种抗生素的处方。

In the nineteenth century, scientists had discovered how harmful some bacteria are, causing disease and infecting wounds. Chapter 27 tells the story of how their ‘germ theory’ of disease became accepted. Straight away, they began looking for drugs that could kill the invading bacteria without harming the cells of the body. It was a quest for ‘magic bullets’ said the German doctor Paul Ehrlich(1854-1915). He came up with a drug to treat syphilis, but it contained arsenic, which is poisonous, so it had to be used very carefully and had serious side effects.

在19世纪，科学家发现了有些细菌非常有害，它们会致病，感染伤口。第27章告诉了我们病菌理论是如何被接受的。他们立刻开始寻找可以杀死所有入侵细菌但不能伤害身体细胞的药物。德国医生Paul Ehrlich(1854-1915)称之为寻找“魔法子弹”的任务。他提出一种治疗梅毒的药，但它含有有毒的砒霜，所以必须小心使用，并且有严重的副作用。

In the mid-1930s, the German pharmacologist Gerhard Domagk (1895-1964) began to use the chemical element sulphur. (Pharmacology is the study of drugs.) He produced a compound called Prontosil, which was effective against several kinds of disease-causing bacteria. One of the first experimental patients was his daughter, whose hand had become infected with Streptococcus, a nasty bacterium that causes infections of the skin. Doctors had said that the only way to try and save her from the life-threatening infection was to amputate her arm. Prontosil successfully cleared up the infection. It was also effective against scarlet fever and a fatal bacterial infection called puerperal fever, which killed women after they had given birth. Prontosil began to be widely used from 1936 and contributed to a dramatic fall in the number of these deaths. It and other sulphur-containing drugs were among the best drugs doctors could prescribe against certain bacteria. Domagk won a Nobel Prize in 1939 (though at the time the Nazis forbade Germans from accepting it).

在20世纪30年代，德国药理学家Gerhard Dogmagk(1895-1964)开始使用化学元素硫（药理学是研究药物的学科）。他制作了一种化合物叫Prontosil（百浪多息），对几种致病的细菌非常有效。他的第一批实验病人有他的女儿，她女儿的手感染了链球菌，这种病菌会感染皮肤。医生说唯一可能制止中可能威胁生命的感染的方法是截肢。Prontosil成功的清除了感染。这种药物对猩红热和产后热也非常有效，产后热会导致产后的妇女死亡。Prontosil从1936年开始广泛使用，使这些疾病的死亡率迅速下降。这与其他含硫药物都是对抗这类细菌的医生可以开出的最好药物。Domagk赢得了1939年的诺贝尔奖（虽然那时候纳粹禁止德国人接受奖项）。

The next Nobel Prize for the discovery of a drug came in 1945. Three men, the Scot Alexander Fleming (1881-1955), the Australian Howard Florey (1898-1968) and the German refugee Ernst Chain (1906-79), shared the prize for the discovery of penicillin, the first 'antibiotic' drug. An antibiotic is a substance produced by one micro-organism that can kill other micro-organisms. It harnesses for our benefit something that happens in the natural world all the time. Penicillin was purified from a natural source, the micro-organism Penicillium notatum, a mould or kind of fungus. You can see small rings of blue fungi growing on old, mouldy bread. If you like to eat mushrooms, you are of course eating another kind of fungus. There are thought to be 1.5 million species of fungi on our planet. They have complex life-cycles including a spore stage, which is similar to the seeds of plants. Today antibiotics can also be created in the laboratory rather than from a natural source, but it's the same basic idea.

下一个赢得诺贝尔奖的药物发现是在1945年。苏格兰人Alexander Fleming（1881-1955），澳大利亚人Howard Florey（1898-1968），德国难民Ernst Chain（1906-1979），这三个人因为发现了盘尼西林而分享了这一奖项，盘尼西林是第一种抗生素药物。抗生素是由一种微生物产生的物质，这种物质可以杀死其他微生物。它利用了自然界中一直在发生的原理为我们谋利。盘尼西林是从自然存在的青霉菌中提纯得到的，青霉菌是一种菌类。你可以在老的发霉的面包上看到一圈一圈的环状霉菌。如果你喜欢吃蘑菇，你是在吃另一种菌类。我们这个星球上可能有150万种菌类。它们的生命循环比较复杂，其中包含了一种孢子阶段，就像植物的种子一样。现在抗生素可以在实验室中制作出来，但其基本的思想是一样的。

Penicillin's story begins in the 1920s. Like all the best stories, there are several versions. One has it that in 1928 a spore of the mould drifted through an open window in Alexander Fleming's laboratory at St Mary's Hospital in London. What he noticed was that some of the bacteria he was growing on a Petri dish stopped growing where the spore had landed. He identified the spore as coming from Penicillium, did more work with it and published his results to share them with other bacteriologists. But he couldn't see how to make enough of whatever the spore had produced to be of any use. So he left it as a curious, possibly promising, laboratory observation.

盘尼西林的故事开始于20年代。和其他最好的故事一样，这也有很多版本。一个版本是，1928年，Alexander Fleming在伦敦St Mary医院的实验室的窗户边上，一些霉菌孢子漂过了开着的窗户，他注意到其中一些孢子落到了他在培养细菌的有盖培养皿上，那些细菌停止了生长。他分析出了那些孢子是从青霉菌中的，又继续了做些工作，然后将结果发表出来，和其他细菌学家进行了分享。但他不知道如何制作出足够的这种孢子或霉菌，来产生一些用处，所以他只能将其当做一种好奇的，有希望的实验室版本故事。

A decade later, Europe was plunged into the Second World War. War always brings outbreaks of infectious diseases, among soldiers and civilians alike. So the pathologist Howard Florey, who had settled in England, was asked to look for effective drugs against infections. One of his associates, Ernst Chain, began reading everything he could find, including Fleming's old paper. Next he tried extracting the active substance produced by the penicillin mould. In March 1940, their laboratory assistant, Norman Heatley(1911-2004), found a better way of obtaining this promising substance. Working in difficult wartime conditions, they had to make do with few resources, using bedpans and milk churns as containers for growing the solutions of mould. Nevertheless, they obtained some relatively pure penicillin. Tests on mice showed that it was very effective in controlling infections. Purifying the miraculous substance was extremely difficult: it took a tonne of a crude solution of penicillin to produce two grams of the drug. Their first patient was a policeman who had become infected after a scratch from a rose thorn. When given the drug, his condition improved briefly. They filtered his urine to recover the precious drug, but he died when the supply ran out.

十年过去，欧洲投入了二战中。战争肯定会在士兵和平民中爆发疾病感染。所以在英国定居的病理学家Howard Florey被请去研究有效的应对药物。他的一个同事，Ernst Chain，开始阅读能找到的所有资料，包括Fleming的老论文。然后他尝试提取青霉菌产生的活跃物质。在1940年3月，他们的实验室助理，Norman Heatley（1911-2004），发现了一种新的方法来提取这种有希望的物质。在艰苦的战时环境里，他们在有限的资源中勉强工作，用便盆或装牛奶的盆来让霉菌溶液生长。尽管如此，他们制作得到了一些相对纯度较高的盘尼西林。在小白鼠的实验里表明对感染的控制非常有效。对这种奇特的物质进行提纯非常困难：对2吨的原始盘尼西林溶液提纯才能得到2克药物。第一位病人是因为玫瑰花刺划到而感染的警察。当用药后，他的状况暂时的得到了改善。他们过滤他的尿液来恢复原来的药物，但当药物供应没有了之后，他去世了。

Wartime Britain did not have the industrial resources to produce enough penicillin. So in July 1941, Florey and Heatley flew to the USA to encourage American pharmaceutical companies to take this on. Florey was an old-fashioned scientist. He believed that discoveries such as theirs were for everyone's good and should not be patented. (Patents are a way of protecting inventors' ideas and making sure that no one else can copy them.) The Americans had other ideas. Two companies in particular developed special methods of producing penicillin on a vast scale. To make back all the money they had invested in the research, they took out patents, which meant that no one else could use their methods to make the drug. By 1943, penicillin was available for military and some civilian use. It was shown to be effective against the Streptococcus bacterium, as well as some of the organisms that cause pneumonia, a lot of wound infections and some sexually transmitted infections. Soon, enough was being made to ensure that those who could be treated would live, when otherwise many would have died, especially the soldiers fighting to end the war.

战时的英国没有相应的工业原料来生产足够的盘尼西林。所以在1941年7月时，Florey和Heatley飞到了美国，鼓励美国药企继续生产。Florey是一个旧式科学家，他觉得他们的发现应当是为了所有人的利益，不应当注册专利（专利是保护发明者的想法的，确保别人不能复制其成果）。但美国人有其他的主意。尤其是两家药企发现了大规模生产盘尼西林的特殊方法后，为了将投入研发的钱赚回来，他们注册了专利，这就意味着别人不能用他们的方法生产这种药品。到1943年，盘尼西林已经可供军用以及部分民用。已经证实对链球菌、其他会导致肺炎的微生物、很多伤口感染和一些性途径传染的感染也有效。很快，就可以生产出足够多的药物，保证得到治疗的人就可以保住性命，而得不到治疗的则会死去，特别是那些为了结束战争继续战斗的士兵。

While Florey and his team were busy with penicillin, Selman Waksman ( 1888-1973) was working on the antibiotic properties of bacteria. Waksman had come from Ukraine to the United States in 1910. He was fascinated by the micro-organisms that live in the soil, and had seen how some of these micro-organisms killed other bacteria in the soil. From the late 1930s, he tried to isolate compounds from these bacteria that could act as antibiotics. With his students, he isolated some effective substances, but they were too toxic to be used in humans. Then, in 1943, one of his students isolated Streptomyces, and the drug streptomycin was made from it. It proved effective and not too harmful to patients. Amazingly, it worked against the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, that deadly disease that had killed more people than any other disease during much of the nineteenth century. Although it was less common in the West by the 1940s, it was still taking its toll everywhere. Its victims were often young adults, leaving loved ones bereft, and children without their parents.

当Florey和他的团队忙着盘尼西林时，Selman Waksman（1888-1973）在细菌的抗生素性能进行了研究。Waksman在1910年从乌克兰来到美国，他对土壤里存在的微生物非常着迷，见到过土壤里一些微生物杀死另一些细菌。从30年代时，他尝试从这些从被用作抗生素的细菌中分离化合物。和他的学生一起，他们分离出了一些有效的物质，但是毒性太大，不能用在人类身上。接着，在1943年，他的一个学生分离出了链霉菌，然后从中制出了链霉素，这种药物证实非常有效，对病人也没有很多害处。令人惊奇的是，这种药物会杀死导致肺结核的细菌，在19世纪时，没有哪种病比肺结核致死的人更多。虽然在40年代时肺结核还不是那么普遍，但仍然到处在造成伤亡。其牺牲者通常是年轻的成人，使一些人失去亲人，孩子没有父母。

Penicillin and streptomycin were just the beginning of a whole range of antibiotics and other chemicals that cured infectious diseases. In the years after the Second World War, they made people very optimistic about the power of medicine to combat and even eradicate such disease. Fewer people in the West died from infections, and with the exception of new infections such as AIDS, this has continued. Without doubt, many young people in the twenty-first century can live healthier lives than their parents or grandparents.

青霉素和链霉素只是整个抗生素系列和其他化学药物的开始，它们可以治愈具有感染性的疾病。在二战后的几年里，人们对药物治疗甚至根治伤病的力量非常乐观，西方极少有人因为传染死亡，但新的传染比如艾滋病仍然继续肆虐。毫无疑问，21世纪的许多年轻人可以比他们的父辈和祖辈过上更健康的生活。

But if the optimists of the 1960s had looked carefully at the story of an earlier 'miracle drug', they might have realized miracles are unlikely. That earlier drug was insulin, used to treat diabetes since the 1920s. Diabetes is a horrible affliction. If it is not treated, the body wastes away, its victims become painfully thin, are always thirsty, urinate frequently and eventually sink into a coma before dying. It mostly affected young people, who died within a couple of years. It is a complicated disease, but the special cells that produce insulin naturally in the pancreas - an organ near the stomach - stop doing their job. Insulin is a hormone, a chemical ‘messenger’ and it keeps the correct amount of sugar (glucose) in our blood.

但如果60年代的乐观者仔细观察了早期的奇迹药物的故事，他们可能可以发现奇迹是不太可能的。早期的药物为胰岛素，从20年代起用于治疗糖尿病。糖尿病是非常折磨人的。如果不进行治疗，身体的养分会流失，受害人会变得非常痛苦非常瘦，经常口渴，尿频，最终昏迷然后死去。得糖尿病后几年后就会死去，得病的主要是年轻人。这是种非常复杂的疾病，但胰腺（靠近胃的一个器官）中自然产生胰岛素的特殊细胞停止工作。胰岛素是一种荷尔蒙，一种化学物质信息使者，它保证血液中的葡萄糖含量适中正确。

While penicillin originated in a lucky chance, the story of insulin is one of painstaking research into how some parts of the body work. Researchers had already shown the role of the pancreas by removing it from dogs (or other animals) that then suffered a diabetes-like illness. Over the summer of 1921, at the University of Toronto, Canada, Professor J.J.R. Macleod (1876-1935) was away. A young surgeon called Frederick Banting (1891-1941) and his medical student assistant Charles Best (1899-1978) conducted a series of simple experiments. With the help of a biochemist, James Collip (1892-1965), they managed to extract and purify insulin from the pancreases of dogs. When they gave the insulin to their experimental animals that had had their pancreases removed, they recovered from their diabetes.

当幸运的发现了盘尼西林的时候，胰岛素的故事还停留在艰苦的研究人体某个部位怎样工作研究者们通过将狗或其他动物的胰腺摘除后，发现动物们也会有和糖尿病类似的症状，从而发现了胰腺的作用。1921年夏天，加拿大多伦多的J.J.R. Macleod教授（1876-1935）都不在岗位。一位年轻的外科医生Frederick Banting（1891-1941）和他的学生助理Charles Best（1899-1978）进行了一系列简单实验。在生物化学家James Collip（1892-1965）的帮助下，他们从狗的胰腺中成功的提取并提纯了胰岛素。当他们将胰岛素注入移除了胰腺的实验动物后，它们的糖尿病治愈了。

Insulin was described as a ‘force of magical activity’. It could literally bring the victims of this kind of diabetes back from certain death. One of them was fourteen-year-old Leonard Thompson, the first person treated with insulin injections in 1922. Leonard was severely underweight and was confined to a hospital bed because he was so weak. The injections brought down his blood sugar towards normal levels, he gained weight, and was able to leave hospital with his syringe and insulin supply.

胰岛素被称为具有“神奇的活力”，它真的可以将这种糖尿病人从死亡线上拉回来，其中一位是14岁的Leonard Thompson，1922年，他是第一个接受胰岛素注射治疗的人。Leonard极其的瘦，由于太过体弱，他只能呆在病床上。注射治疗将其血糖水平拉回到了正常水平，他增加了体重，带着注射器和胰岛素离开了医院。

One year later, Banting and Professor Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize, and shared the prize money with Best and Collip. Such speedy recognition showed how important everyone considered their work to be. Insulin was very important. It offered years of extra life to many young people who would otherwise have died. What it didn't offer was a normal life. Diabetics had to monitor their food, give themselves regular insulin injections, and frequently test their urine for sugar. This was much better than nothing. But a decade or two later, many of these early diabetics began to suffer from other health problems: kidney failure, heart disease, difficulties with their eyesight and painful ulcers on their legs that refused to heal. Insulin changed an acute fatal disease into a lifelong problem to be managed forever. The same problems also apply to the other kind of diabetes, which occurs mostly in overweight adults and is called Type II diabetes. It is now the most common form, and more and more people suffer from it. Modern diets contain too much sugar and refined foods, and obesity has become a global epidemic. Medical science has helped: pills can lower the blood sugar. But Type II diabetics face the same kind of problems in later life. Medicine is simply not as good as our own natural systems at regulating the level of sugar in our bodies.

一年后，Banting和Macleod教授获得了诺贝尔奖，并和Best和Collip分享奖金。这么迅速就获得了认可，这说明所有人都认为他们的工作很重要。胰岛素非常重要。这给了许多年轻人很多年额外的生命，没有了胰岛素，他们就去死去。但胰岛素并不能给这些人正常的生活。糖尿病人并须监控他们的饮食，定期注射胰岛素，频繁的测试尿液含糖量，但这总比啥都没有好。但在一二十年后，很多这些早期糖尿病人开始遭受其他健康问题：肾功能衰竭，心脏病，视力问题，还有腿上难以治愈的痛苦的溃疡。胰岛素将这种致命的急病变成了一生的慢性病。别的类型的糖尿病也有相同的问题，主要是超重的人，被称为II型糖尿病。现在主要是这种类型的糖尿病，越来越多的人有这种问题。现代饮食含糖量太高，也太过精细，肥胖症已经称为全球性的问题。药学有相应的解决办法，现在有药物可以降低血糖。但II型糖尿病在日后的生活中有着同样的问题。在控制身体的血糖水平上，药物还是不如我们自身的功能。

Nature has shown us that we can't rely on penicillin and other antibiotics. These drugs are still useful, but the bacteria that cause disease have adapted to them. Darwin's discovery of natural selection applies throughout nature, and many bacteria have developed defenses against the antibiotics that used to kill them. The Staphylococci and the tubercle bacillus (which causes tuberculosis) have shown themselves to be especially adaptable. Like all other living creatures, their own genes sometimes mutate, and the mutations that help them to survive are the ones that pass on to the next generation. Treating infections has now become a kind of cat-and-mouse game: developing new drugs to attack germs that evolve to resist almost anything we can throw at them. One recent problem is MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). S. aureas is one of those bacteria that normally lives on our bodies, even if it may cause the usual slight infection after a scratch. Its antibiotic-resistant form is dangerous. It is commonly found in hospitals because so many antibiotics are used there, and the bacteria that do survive are often those that have developed resistance. And it is not just bacteria that fight back against our attempts to control disease. Some of the parasites that cause malaria are resistant to almost all the drugs we have.

自然向我们展示了，我们还是不能依靠盘尼西林和其他抗生素。这些药物仍然有用，但致病的细菌已经对这些药物显示出了惯性。达尔文的自然选择学说对自然界所有生物都适用，许多病菌已经对过去杀死它们的抗生素发展出了防御机制。葡萄状球菌和结核杆菌（会导致肺结核）适应能力尤其强。就像其他生物一样，它们的基因也会变异，而那些使其存活的变异会遗传到下一代。治疗传染病现在已经成了一种猫鼠游戏：病菌进化对药物产生抗药性，然后研制新药攻击病菌。一个最近的问题是MRSA（抗甲氧西林葡萄球菌奥里斯）。葡萄球菌奥里斯是一种正常情况下生活在我们体内的细菌，在抓伤后会导致轻微的感染。但其抗抗生素变体却非常危险，变体通常发现在医院，因为医院里抗生素用的非常多，存活下来的病菌通常都发展出了抗药性。而且不仅是病菌会抵抗我们对疾病的控制，一些会导致疟疾的寄生虫也会对我们用的药产生抗药性。

We now know that bugs tend to develop their resistance when patients don't finish taking the full course of their medicine, or when the wrong dose is given. It also happens when the drugs are misused: antibiotics are often given to patients inappropriately, for infections, colds or sore throats caused by viruses. (Antibiotics fight bacteria, and can do nothing against viruses.) If your dose of antibiotics is not enough to kill the disease-causing bacteria, the treatment can instead help resistant bacteria to survive. Those bacteria might in the future cause untreatable disease.

我们现在知道如果病人不停用药，或者吃错了剂量，病菌会产生抗药性，当错用药的时候也会发生这种情况：病人经常用到不适合的抗生素，来治疗病毒导致的传染、感冒或者喉咙酸痛（抗生素对抗病菌，但对病毒却没有作用）。如果抗生素的剂量不足以杀死致病的病菌，那么这种治疗反而会使顽固的病菌存活。将来这种病菌会导致无法治愈的疾病。

Despite all these problems, doctors have many more powerful and effective drugs than ever before. Some, like insulin, control rather than cure the disease, but all these modern medicines have given people in the 'developed' world the chance to live longer lives. In many countries in the 'developing' world, too, life expectancy has also risen. But there, serious problems remain: it is not always easy to see a doctor, get enough to eat, drink clean water, or live in a comfortable home. Since the early 1990s, the gap between rich and poor has widened in rich countries, and has widened too between the rich and the poor countries. This shouldn't be.

尽管有这些问题，医生们比以前有很多强力有效的药物。一些药物像胰岛素仅仅控制病情，而不能治愈疾病，但现代药物使人们在“发达”的世界里有机会存活更长的时间。在很多发展中国家，预期寿命同样得到了增加。但在那里仍然存在严重的问题，看医生、得到足够的食物、喝到干净的水、在舒适的家中生活，这些都不是那么容易。在90年代前期，富裕国家里的贫富差距增大，贫富国家间的差距也在变大。这些都是不该发生的事情。

Today it costs a lot of money to provide medical care. We use a lot of clever technology to diagnose illness and then treat it. Developing and testing new drugs now takes much more money than it did to produce penicillin. So we need to look after ourselves if we can. No matter how amazing the medicines, it is still true that ‘prevention is better than cure’.

现在提供医疗服务耗费大量财力。我们用了很多技术诊断病症并进行治疗。研发和测试药物所耗费的财力比生产盘尼西林耗费的多的多。所以我们要照顾好自己，不管药物多么神奇，预防优于治疗仍然是正确的。

# CHAPTER 2 Needles and Numbers
# 第2章 指针和数字

Keep on traveling eastwards from Babylon and Egypt and you'll find lands where ancient civilizations flourished on either side of the rocky Himalayas, in India and China. Some 5,000 years ago people were living there in towns and cities ranged along the Indus and Yellow River valleys. In those days, India and China were both immense territories, even larger than they are today. Both were part of vast overland and overseas trading networks – channeled along the spice routes - and their people had developed writing and science to a high level. The one helped the other: science benefited trade, and the wealth from trade allowed the luxury of study. In fact until about 1500, science in each of these civilizations was at least as advanced as in Europe. India gave us our numbers and a love of mathematics. From China came paper and gunpowder and that indispensable gadget for navigation: the compass.

从巴比伦和埃及往东行走，就会发现在喜马拉雅的群山两边都有繁盛的古文明，这就是印度和中国。大约5000年前，人们就在沿着印度河和黄河的谷地组成了村庄和城市居住。在那些时代里，印度和中国都有着广阔的疆域，甚至比今天还要辽阔。两者都是巨大的跨大陆、跨海贸易网络的一部分（沿着香料路线），其人民将文字和科学发展到了很高的高度。科学与贸易互相助益：科学使贸易获益，贸易获得的利益让奢侈的研究变得可能。直到1500年以前，这两个文明的科学至少与欧洲是一样发达的。印度给我们提供了数字和对数学的爱好，中国传来了造纸术和火药，以及航海必不可少的工具：指南针。

Today, China is a major force in the world. Things like clothes, toys and electronic goods made there are sold all over the globe: check the label in your trainers. For centuries, however, people in the West looked at this vast country with amusement or suspicion. The Chinese did things their way; their country seemed both mysterious and unchanging.

今天，中国是世界的一股主要力量。像衣服、玩具和电子产品生产了以后卖到了全世界：检查一下你运动鞋上的标签。但几个世纪以来，西方的人们总是带着戏谑或怀疑的眼光观察着这个巨大的国家。中国人以他们的方式做事情，他们的国家看起来既神秘又稳定。

We now know that China was always a dynamic country, and that its science too was constantly changing. But one thing remained unchanged there over the centuries: writing. Chinese writing is made up of ideographs, little pictures that represent objects, which look strange to alphabet users like us. But if you know how to interpret the little pictures, it means you can read old - very old - Chinese texts as easily as you can read more recent writings. In fact, we have China to thank for the invention of paper, which made writing much easier. The oldest example we know about dates from about AD 150.

我们现在知道中国总是一个动态的国家，其科学也是一直在改变的。但有一个东西是很多世纪以来都没有改变的：文字。中国的文字是由象形文字组成的，象形文字是表示物体的小图画，对于字母使用者的我们来说，看起来非常奇怪。但如果你知道怎么解释这些小图画，这就意味着你能像阅读更新一点的文字一样阅读古老，非常古老的中国文字。实际上，我们应当感谢中国发明了造纸术，这使得文字的书写容易了很多。我们所知的最古老的样本大约在公元150年左右。

Ruling China was never easy, but science could help. Perhaps the greatest-ever engineering project, the Great Wall of China, was begun during the fifth century BC, during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. (Chinese history is divided into dynasties, associated with powerful rulers and their courts.) The Wall was meant to keep the barbarians from the north out, as well as to keep the Chinese in! It took centuries to complete, being constantly extended and repaired, and now runs for 5,500 miles. (For some years people thought the Wall could be seen from space, but it's not true: China's own astronaut failed to spot the structure.) Another remarkable engineering feat, the Grand Canal, was started under the Sui Dynasty, in the fifth century. Making use of some natural waterways enroute, the thousand-mile Canal connected the large inland city of Beijing in the north with Hangzhou on the southern coast, and from there to the outside world. These monuments are powerful reminders of the skills of Chinese surveyors and engineers, but also of the tremendous amount of hard human labor their construction needed. The Chinese had invented the wheelbarrow, but laborers still had to dig, push and build.

统治中国从来没那么容易，但科学可以帮助统治。中国的长城，可能是最伟大的工程项目，开始于公元前5世纪的东周（中国历史是按照朝代划分的，每个朝代都有强力的统治者和宫廷）。长城是要将北部边境外的野蛮人阻挡在外面，同样也是为了将中国人控制在里面！长城的建造花费了几个世纪的时间，并一直在延伸和维护，现在的长度大约为5500英里（有几年人们认为长城可以从外太空看到，但这不是真的：中国自己的宇航员没有看到这个巨型结构）。另一项杰出的工程壮举，大运河，始建于5世纪的隋朝。大运河取道于一些自然水路，绵延上千英里，连接了内陆北部大城市北京和东南沿海城市杭州，从杭州连接了外部世界。这些遗迹提示我们中国工程技术人员技术的伟大，同时也需要巨量的人工来建造。中国人发明了独轮手推车，但工人们仍然需要挖、推、建造。

The Chinese viewed the universe as a kind of living organism, in which forces connected everything. The fundamental force, or energy, was called Qi (pronounced Chee). Two other basic forces were yin and yang: yin, the female principle, was associated with darkness, clouds and moisture; yang, the male principle, with ideas of sunshine, heat and warmth. Things are never either all yin or all yang - the two forces are always combined in various degrees. According to Chinese philosophy, each of us has some yin and some yang, and the exact combination affects who we are and how we behave.

中国人将宇宙视为一个生命体，其中力量连接着所有事物。最基础的力量，或能量，被称为气。另两种力是阴和阳：阴是雌性的法则，与阴暗、乌云和潮湿关联；阳是雄性的法则，与日照、热量和温暖关联。事物都不是纯阴或纯阳的，这两种力可以以不同程度结合起来。根据中国人的哲学，我们每个人都是部分阴部分阳的，其精确的组合影响着我们是谁，以及我们的行动。

The Chinese believed that the universe was made up of five elements: water, metal, wood, fire and earth. These elements were not simply the ordinary water or fire that we see around us, but principles that went together to compose the world and the heavens. Each had different characteristics, of course, but also interlocking powers, much like Transformer toys. For example, wood could overcome earth (a wooden spade can dig it); metal could chisel wood; fire could melt metal; water could extinguish fire; and earth could dam water. (Think of the game Paper, Scissors, Stone, actually invented in China.) These elements, combined with the forces of yin and yang, produce the cyclical rhythms of time and nature, the seasons, cycles of birth and death, and the movements of the sun, stars and planets.

中国人认为宇宙是由五种元素构成的：水、金、木、火和土。这些元素不是简单的我们看到的水或火，而是一同构成了我们的世界和上天的本原。每种元素都有不同的性质，也具有相应的能量，很像变形金刚玩具。比如，木克土（木铲子可以挖土），金克木，火克金，水克火，土克水（想想剪刀石头布的游戏，也是在中国发明的）。这些元素和阴阳之力一起，产生了时间和自然的循环节奏，季节的循环，生死的循环，还有太阳、星星和行星的运动。

Since everything is made up of these elements and forces, everything is in some sense alive and joined. So a notion of the 'atom' as a basic unit of matter never developed in China. Nor did natural philosophers there think that they had to express everything with numbers in order for it to be ‘scientific’. Arithmetic was very practical: doing your sums when you were buying and selling, weighing goods, and so on. The abacus, a device with sliding beads on wires that you might have learned to count on, was written about in the late 1500s. It was probably invented earlier. An abacus speeds up counting, as well as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

既然所有事物都是由这些元素和力组成的，那么所有事物都在一定意义上是活着的，也是互相关联的。所以“原子”这种物质基本组成单位的概念没有在中国产生出来。自然哲学家也不会想到用数字来对所有事物进行表达，以示这是科学的。算术是很实用的：做买卖、给货物称重量时进行计算，等等。16世纪晚期对算盘进行了记述，算盘是一种在木条上串上了滑动的珠子以进行计数的工具，很可能是更早时候发明的，算盘使计数更容易，同样也使加减乘除更容易。

Numbers were also used to calculate the length of the days and years. As early as 1400BC, the Chinese knew that the year is 3651/4 days long, and, like most early civilizations, they used the moon to calculate the months. As with all ancient peoples, the Chinese measured a year as being the length of time it took for the sun to return to its starting point in the sky. The cycles in the movements of planets like Jupiter, and of the stars, fit nicely into the idea that everything in nature is cyclical. The 'Supreme Ultimate Grand Origin' was an immense calculation to find out how long it would take for the whole universe to make a complete cycle: 23,639,040 years. This meant that the universe was very old (though we now know it is much older). The Chinese also thought about how the universe was structured. Some of the early Chinese star maps show that they understood how to represent, on a two-dimensional map, things that exist in a curved space. Xuan Le, who lived in the later Han Dynasty (AD 25-220), believed that the sun, moon and stars floated in empty space, driven by the winds. This was very different to the ancient Greek belief that these heavenly bodies were fixed in solid spheres, and is much more like how we understand space today. Stargazers in China recorded unusual events very carefully, so their records, since they go back so far, are still useful to modern astronomers.

数字同样用于计算一天和一年的时长。早在公元前1400年，中国人就知道每年是3651/4天，就像多数早期文明一样，他们用月亮来计算月份。和所有古代民族一样，中国人定义一年为太阳回到天空中的最初位置所需的时间。像木星这样的行星的运动，以及其他行星的运动，与自然界中所有事物都是循环的概念非常吻合。“太极上元”是计算出来的整个宇宙进行整个循环需要的时间：23,639,040年。这意味着宇宙是非常古老的（虽然我们现在知道其实更加古老）。中国人对宇宙的构造也进行了思考。一些早期的中国星图显示，他们知道怎样在二维地图上描绘弯曲空间中的事物。东汉时期的Xuan Le，认为太阳、月亮和星星在空荡荡的空间中靠风力悬浮着。这和古希腊是不同的，古希腊认为这些天体是在固体圆球中固定住的，中国人的理解更接近现在的知识。中国的观星者小心的记录了天空中的异常事件，由于中国历史久远，所以他们的记录对今天的天文学家仍然非常有用。

Since the Chinese believed that the earth was very old, they had no difficulty recognizing fossils as the hardened remains of plants and animals that had once been alive. Stones were grouped according to such things as hardness and color. Jade was especially prized, and craftsmen carved pieces of jade into beautiful statues. Earthquakes are common in China, and although no one could explain why they occur, in the second century AD, a very learned man called Zhang Heng used a hanging weight that swayed when the earth shook, to record the earth's tremors. This was a very early version of what we call a seismograph, a machine which draws a straight line until the earth moves, when it wiggles.

由于中国人相信地球是非常古老的，他们很轻松的识别出了那些化石就是以前活着的动植物的硬化残骸。石头根据硬度和颜色进行分类，翡翠的价值尤其的高，匠人们将翡翠雕刻成漂亮的雕像。地震在中国非常普遍，在公元前的时间里没人能解释为什么发生，而一个非常博学的人，张衡，用一种吊着的重物记录地震，当地震发生时重物就会摆动。这是地震仪非常早期的样子，当地震发生时，机器摆动，画出一条直线。

Magnetism was understood for practical purposes. The Chinese learned how to magnetize iron by heating it to a high temperature and letting it cool while it was pointing in a north-south direction. China had compasses long before they were known in the West, and they were used both for navigation and for fortune telling. Most commonly, they were 'wet': just a magnetized needle floating in a bowl of water. We are used to saying that compass needles point north, but for the Chinese they pointed south. (Of course our compasses point south too - just with the opposite end of the needle. It doesn't really matter which direction you choose, as long as everyone agrees on it.)

磁力被用在非常实用的地方。中国制造磁铁的方法是，先将铁加热到很高的温度，然后在冷却的时候沿着南北方向指向。中国很早就有了指南针，而这在西方到了很晚才知道，这被用于航海和算命。它们通常都是湿的：就是一个磁针浮在水里。我们习惯了说指南针指北，但对中国人来说是指南的（当然我们的指南针也指南，只是针被放到了另外一端而已，指向哪个方向其实并不重要，只要所有人都有一致意见就好）。

The Chinese were skilled chemists. Many of the best were Taoists, members of a religious group who followed Lau Tsu, who lived some time between the sixth and the fourth century BC. (Tao means 'Way' or 'Path'.) Others followed Confucius or the Buddha. The philosophies of these religious leaders influenced the attitudes of their followers towards the study of the universe. Religion has always influenced how people view their surroundings.

中国人是非常娴熟的化学家。很多最好的化学家都是道士，他们是信奉老子的宗教群体，老子生活在公元前6到4世纪（Tao意思是道或路）。其他人信奉孔子或佛陀。这些宗教领袖的哲学思想影响了其追随者关于宇宙研究的态度。宗教总是对人们怎样看待周围事物有所影响。

The chemistry that the Chinese were able to perform was quite sophisticated for their time. For instance, they could distil alcohol and other substances, and could extract copper from solutions. By blending charcoal, sulphur and potassium nitrate, they made gunpowder. This was the first chemical explosive and the spring-board for the invention of both fireworks and weapons. You could say gunpowder showed the yin and yang of the chemical world: it exploded prettily in tremendous firework displays at court while also being used to fire guns and cannons on eastern battlefields as early as the tenth century. It is not certain exactly how the recipe and instructions for making this powerful substance arrived in Europe, but there is a description of it there in the 1280s. It gradually made war everywhere more deadly.

中国人能进行的化学实验对其时代来说是非常复杂的。比如，他们可以蒸馏酒精和其他物质，还能从溶液中提取铜。通过将木炭、硫磺和硝酸钾混合在一起，他们制作出了火药。这是第一种爆炸性的化学物质，是发明烟花和武器的一个跳板。你可以说火药展示了化学世界的阴阳性质：这表现在宫廷的宏大焰火表演中，也表现在西方战场上早在10世纪时的火枪和加农炮中。火药的制作方法是怎样传入欧洲的仍然没有确切的知道，但在13世纪80年代有这样的记述。这逐渐的使战争越来越致命。

The Chinese also had alchemists, who sought the 'elixir of life': some substance that would increase how long we can live, or maybe even make us immortal. (There is more about alchemy in Chapter 9.) They failed to find it, and in fact several emperors would have lived longer had they not taken these experimental, poisonous ‘cures’. However, searching for this magical substance revealed many drugs that could be used to treat ordinary diseases. As in Europe, Chinese doctors used extracts of plants to treat diseases, but they also made compounds from sulphur, mercury and other substances. The Artemisia plant was used to treat fevers. It was made into an extract and burnt on the skin at specific points to aid the flow of the ‘vital juices’. The recipe and method were recently discovered in a book about drugs written around 1,800 years ago. Tested in a modern laboratory, it was found to be effective against malaria, a leading cause of death today in tropical countries. One of the symptoms of malaria is a high fever.

中国人中也有炼金士，都是那些寻找长生不老药的人，长生不老药可以使长寿，甚至让我们不死（第9章中有关于炼金术更多描述）。没有找到这种药，事实上有几个皇帝如果不吃这些毒药，还能活的更长一些。但是，在寻找这种神奇物质的过程中，找到了很多可以治疗平常疾病的药物。和在欧洲一样，中国医生利用从植物中提取的东西来治病，但也用硫、汞和其他物质制造出来的物质。蒿类植物用于治疗发热，制成提取物后，放在皮肤的固定点上，帮助“生命汁液”流动。这些秘方和方法是在最近发现的一本1800年前的树上写的。在现代实验室中测试后，发现这些药物和方法对疟疾是有效的，疟疾是今天的热带国家导致死亡最多的疾病之一。疟疾的一个症状就是高烧。

Medical books began to be written in China as early as the second century BC, and ancient Chinese medicine lives on throughout the world today. Acupuncture, which involves sticking needles into certain areas of the skin, is widely practiced to help cure disease, deal with stress, and ease pain. It is based on the idea that the body has a series of channels through which the Qi energy flows, and so the acupuncturist uses the needles to stimulate or unblock these channels. Sometimes operations are carried out with little more than the needles inserted into the patient's body to block out the pain. Modern Chinese scientists work just like their colleagues in the West, but Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) still has many followers all over the world.

早在公元前2世纪就有中国人开始撰写医学书籍，古中医一直流传到了现在。针灸，就是将针刺入人体特定部位的皮肤，应用的非常广泛，可以用于减压、止痛。针灸的原理是基于人体有一系列气流动的通道，针灸医生用针来刺激或者疏通这些通道。有时候一个小手术，用仅仅比针大一点的东西，刺入人体，就可以止痛。现在中国科学家与西方的同事工作内容基本相同，但传统中医在世界各地仍然有很多追随者。

So does traditional Indian medicine. It is called Ayurveda, and is based on works known by this name written in the ancient language, Sanskrit, between about 200 BC and AD 600. Ayurveda taught that there are fluids in the body, called doshas. There were three of these: vata is dry, cold and light; pitta is hot, sour and pungent; and kapha is cold, heavy and sweet. These doshas are necessary for the proper functioning of our bodies, and when there is too much or too little of one or more of them, or when they are in the wrong place, disease occurs. Inspecting the patient's skin, and feeling the pulse, were also very important as the Indian doctor tried to decide what the disease was. Drugs, massage and special diets could correct the imbalance. Indian doctors used the juice from the poppy, which produces the drug opium, to calm their patients and relieve their pain.

传统印度医学也是这样的，其被称为印度韦达养生学Ayurveda，是基于Sanskrit在公元前200年到公元600年所写的著作中。Ayurveda认为人体中有流体，称为doshas。有三种doshas：vata是干、冷和亮的；pitta是热，酸和辣的；kapha是冷、重和甜的。这些doshas对于人体的正常运转是必不可少的，当其中一种过多或过少，或者位置不对，就会产生疾病。检查病人的皮肤，感受其脉搏，对于印度医生确定病人病情也非常重要。药物，按摩和特殊的饮食都可以修正体内的不平衡。印度医生用罂粟的汁液（可以制成鸦片）来让病人冷静下来，缓解病人病痛。

One other ancient Indian medical work, the Susruta, concentrated on surgery. Some of the operations it describes are remarkably delicate for this early period. For example, when a patient suffered from a cataract (a clouding in the lens of the eye which makes it hard to see) the surgeon would gently stick a needle into the eyeball and push the cataract to one side. Indian surgeons also used flaps of the patient's own skin to repair damaged noses, probably the earliest instance of what we call plastic surgery.

另一种古印度的医学工作是Susruta，其重点是外科手术。据描述一些手术是极其精细的，对于那个早期时代来说。比如，当一个病人患有白内障时（眼睛晶状体上有浑浊，视力下降），外科医生会将一根针小心的刺入眼球中，将浑浊拨到一边。印度外科医生还使用病人自己的部分皮肤还修复受损的鼻子，这可能是最早的外科整形手术的例子。

This Ayurvedic medicine was associated with Hindu practitioners. When Muslims also settled in India in about 1590, they brought their own medical ideas, based on ancient Greek medicine interpreted by early Islamic doctors. This medicine, called Yunani (which means 'Greek'), developed side by side with the Ayurvedic system. Both continue to be used in India today alongside the medicine we are all familiar with - Western medicine.

Ayurveda医学是和印度教徒相关的。当穆斯林在1590年定居印度时，他们带来了他们自己的医学主张，这是基于早期伊斯兰医生解释的古希腊医学。这种医学，称为Yunani（意思是“希腊”），与Ayurveda医学系统并肩发展，在印度一直持续使用到今天，同时现在也在使用我们都熟悉的西医。

India had its own scientific traditions. Stargazers in India made sense of the heavens, the stars, sun and moon by drawing on the work of the Greek astronomer Ptolemy, and some scientific works from China that had been brought back by Indian Buddhist missionaries. There was an observatory at Ujjain, and one of the earliest Indian scientists whose name we know, Varahamihira (c. 505), worked there. He collected old astronomical works and added his own observations. Much later, in the sixteenth century, observatories were built at Delhi and Jaipur. The Indian calendar was quite accurate, and like the Chinese, Indians believed that the earth was very old. One of their astronomical cycles was 4,320,000 years long. Indians shared in the search for an elixir that would convey long life. They also looked for a way to create gold from ordinary metals. But the most important contribution made by Indian science was in mathematics.

印度有其自己的科学传统。印度的观星者吸收了希腊天文学家托勒密的思想，同时还从去中国的印度佛教传教士那里吸收了中国的科学思想，形成了自己解释天空、太阳、月亮和星星的体系。在乌贾因(Ujjain)有一个天文台，我们所知道的最早的印度科学家，Varahamihira，在这里工作。他收集早期天文学工作，并加入了自己的观测。很久以后，在16世纪，在Delhi和Jaipur建造了新的天文台。印度历法非常精确，和中国人一样，印度人相信地球是非常古老的。他们的其中一个宇宙循环是4,320,000年。印度人也寻求过长生不老药，他们还寻找一种从普通金属中制造金子的方法，但印度科学最重要的贡献是在数学上。

It is from India, via the Middle East, that we have the numbers we call 'Arabic': the familiar 1, 2, 3 and so forth. The idea of 'zero' first came from India, too. Along with the numbers we still use, Indian mathematicians also had the basic idea of 'place-holding: Take a number like 170. The '1' = 100, it holds the 'hundreds' place; the '7' = 70, it holds the 'tens' place; and the zero holds the 'units' place. It comes so naturally to us that we don't even think about it, but if we didn't have place-holding, writing large numbers would be much more complicated. The most famous ancient Indian mathematician, Brahmagutpa, who lived in the seventh century, worked out how to calculate the volumes of prisms and other figures. He was the first person to mention the number ‘0’ and knew that anything multiplied by 0 is 0. It took almost 500 years before another Indian mathematician, Bhaskara (b. 1115) pointed out that anything divided by 0 would be infinity. Modern mathematical explanations of the world would be impossible without these concepts.

阿拉伯数字最初起源于印度，经由中东，最后广为人所知：熟悉的1,2,3以及等等。零的概念最初也是从印度起源的。不光是我们现在使用的数字，印度数学家还发明了占位符的基本概念：以170这个数为例，这里的1就是100，它占了百位，这里的7就是70，它占了十位，这里的0占了个位。这对于我们来说太自然了，我们都不会想到它，但如果没有占位符，记录大数会非常麻烦。最有名的印度古数学家，Brahmagutpa，生活在7世纪，找到了计算棱镜以及其他形状体积的方法。他是第一个提到零的概念的人，指出零乘以任何数都是零。大约500年后，另一个印度数学家，Bhaskara (b. 1115)指出任何数除以0将得到无穷大。没有这些，将不会有我们现代数学的解释。

Whereas traditional medical systems in India and China still compete with Western medicine, in science it's different. Indian and Chinese scientists work with the same ideas, tools and aims as their colleagues elsewhere in the world. Whether in Asia or anywhere else, science now is a universal science, which developed in the West.

尽管传统印度和中国的医学体系仍然与西医竞争，科学上则不是这样。印度和中国科学家与世界其他地方的科学家工作理念、工具和目标都是一样的。不管是在亚洲还是在其他地方，源于西方的科学现在是通用的科学。

But remember that we got numbers from India, and paper from China. Write out the '9 times' table, and you are using gifts that are very old, and from the East.

但要记住，印度发明了数字，中国发明了造纸。写下九九乘法表的时候，你就在使用东方的古老礼物。

# CHAPTER 34 What Do We Inherit
# 第34章 我们遗传了什么

Who do you look most like - mum or dad? Or perhaps a grandfather or aunt? If you are good at football or play the guitar or flute very well, does someone else in your family have these characteristics too? It has to be someone you are biologically related to and from whom you could have inherited these things, not just a relative by marriage, like a stepmother or stepfather. These relatives can do wonderful things for you, but you cannot inherit any of their genes.

你和谁长的最像？妈妈还是爸爸？又或者是爷爷或姑妈？如果你足球踢的很好，吉他或长笛演奏的很好，你的家族里其他人有没有相同的特质？你只能从生物学上有关系的人身上遗传这些东西，而不能从婚姻得到的亲戚关系，比如继母或继父，这样的人身上遗传。这些亲戚可以对你非常好，但你不能遗传他们的任何基因。

We know now that things like the color of our eyes or hair are controlled and passed from one generation to the next through our genes. Genetics is the study of our genes. Heredity or inheritance are the words we use to describe how the information our genes possess is passed on. Our genes determine an awful lot about who we are. So how did people realize these tiny things were so important?

我们现在知道像我们眼睛或者头发的颜色是通过基因从一代遗传到下一代的。基因学是关于基因的研究，遗传性描述的是我们基因的信息是如何传递的。我们的基因基本上决定了我们是什么样子的。人们是怎么发现这个小东西的重要性的呢？

Let's go back to Charles Darwin for a moment (Chapter 25). Heredity was central to Darwin's work. It was vital to his ideas on the evolution of species, even if he hadn't worked out how heredity occurs. Biologists continued to debate how it happens long after his book On the Origin of Species was published in 1859. In particular, they were interested in whether 'soft' heredity can sometimes happen. Soft heredity was an idea associated with a French naturalist, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829), who also believed in the development of species by evolutionary change. Think about a giraffe's long neck: how had that evolved over time? Lamarck said it was because as giraffes continually stretch upwards to reach the leaves on the tallest trees so this slight change will be passed on to their offspring generation after generation. Given enough time and enough stretching, a shorter-necked animal would eventually become a longer-necked one. The environment would interact with the organism, shaping or adapting it, and that would be passed on to the following generations.

让我们回顾一下达尔文（见第25章）。遗传性是达尔文的中心工作。虽然他没有研究出遗传是如何进行的，但遗传确实他的物种进化理论非常重要。1959年《物种起源》发表后，生物学家就遗传是如何进行的进行了长久的辩论。他们尤其对“软”遗传是否可能发生感兴趣。软遗传是一个法国博物学家Jean-Baptiste Lamarck（1744-1829）提出的思想，他相信生物通过进化中的变化来发展。想想长颈鹿的脖子：这是如何经过时间进化到现在这种样子的？Lamarck认为，这是因为长颈鹿长年伸长脖子去吃最高的树上的叶子，所以这些点滴的变化会一代一代遗传到其后代。只要有足够长的时间和足够的伸长，一个短脖子的动物会最终变成长脖子。环境会与生物互动，塑造它，适应它，这会遗传到其子代中。

Trying to prove soft heredity experimentally was very difficult. Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton (1822-1911), performed a careful series of experiments, in which he introduced the blood of black rabbits into white ones. The offspring of the transfused rabbits showed no sign of being affected by the blood. He cut off rats' tails for generations on end, but did not produce a race of tailless rats. Circumcising young boys had not had any effect on future generations of male babies.

通过实验证实软遗传的理论非常困难。达尔文的表弟，Francis Galton（1822-1911），开展了一系列小心的实验，他将黑兔子的血液输入白兔子的体内，但被输血的兔子的后代丝毫没有被血液影响的迹象。他将很多代的老鼠的尾巴剪掉，但并没有产生没有尾巴的老鼠。对年轻男孩割包皮，并不会对后代的男孩产生任何影响。

Arguments for and against were bandied about until the early 1900s. Then two things convinced most biologists that the traits plants or animals had simply acquired during their life are not passed on to their offspring. First came the rediscovery of the work of a monk from Moravia (now part of the Czech Republic), Gregor Mendel (1822-84). In the 1860s, Mendel had published (in a little-read journal) the results of his experiments in the monastery garden. He had become fascinated with peas, even before Galton was cutting off the tails of his rats. Mendel wondered what happened when pea plants with certain characteristics were carefully 'crossed' (that is, plants with differently colored peas were bred together), to provide the next generation of pea plants. Peas were good to work with because they grew fast, so it was quick and easy to move from one generation to the next. And, in the pod they also had clear differences - the peas were either yellow or green, in wrinkled or smooth skins. He discovered that these traits were inherited with mathematical precision, but in ways that could be easily overlooked. If a plant with green peas (its seeds) was crossed with a yellow one, all the first generation of peas were yellow. But when he crossed these first-generation plants with each other, in the second generation three of every four plants would have yellow peas and one would have green. The yellow trait had dominated in the first generation, but in the second, the 'recessive' trait (the green) showed itself again. What did these strong patterns mean? Mendel concluded that heredity is 'particulate', that is, that plants and animals inherit traits in separate units. Rather than the little-by-little changes of soft heredity, or some average of the attributes of the two parents, heredity was something quite definite. Peas were either green or yellow, and not some shade in between.

支持和反对的观点来回争论到1900年，这时有两件事说服了生物学家，动物或植物活着的时候获得的特质不会遗传到其后代。第一个是摩拉维亚（现捷克的一部分）的一位神父，Gregor Mendel（1822-1884），的工作的再发现。在19世纪60年代，Mendel在一个小众刊物发表了他在修道院花园的实验结果。他在Galton切老鼠尾巴之前就对豌豆很着迷。Mendel想知道具有不同特征的豌豆杂交（即，具有不同颜色的豌豆在一起培育）产生下一代豌豆植物时会发生什么。用豌豆做实验很方便因为生长速度快，所以研究一代一代间的特征遗传时容易方便。豌豆荚之间的区别也很明显，要么是黄色或绿色，要么是豌豆表面光滑或褶皱。他发现这些特征的遗传非常精确，但非常容易忽视。如果绿色的豌豆种和黄色的豌豆种杂交，所有第一代的豌豆都是黄色的。但当他将这些所有的第一代豌豆进行杂交，第二代的豌豆中都3/4是黄色的，1/4是绿色的。黄色的特征在第一代中是占绝对主要地位的，但在第二代中，绿色的隐性特征也显示出来了。这么明显的模式说明了什么？Mendel得出结论，遗传性是颗粒性的（particulate），即，动物和植物从分离的单位中得到遗传特征。不像软遗传的那种一点一点的渐进改变，或者两个父辈特征的平均融合，遗传性是非常确定的。豌豆不是黄的就是绿的，而不是黄绿中的某种混合色。

While Mendel's work lay unnoticed, August Weismann (1834-1914) provided the second critical assault on soft heredity. Where Mendel was mostly concerned with his religious life, Weismann was first and foremost a determined scientist. A brilliant German biologist, he strongly believed that Darwin's evolutionary views were correct. But he could see that the lack of a good explanation for heredity was a problem. He turned his own fascination with cells and cell division into a solution.

当Mendel的工作无人注意的时候，August Weismann（1834-1914）对软遗传进行了第二次决定性攻击。Mendel主要沉浸在自己的宗教生活中，而Weismann则首先是一个坚决的科学家，一个杰出的德国生物学家。他坚信达尔文的进化论观点是对的，但他看得出，缺少好的遗传解释是一个问题。他将注意力放到了细胞上，细胞分裂成了一种解决办法。

A few years before Mendel's experiments with his peas, Rudolf Virchow had announced his ideas about cell division (Chapter 26). In the 1880s and 1890s Weismann saw that to make an egg or a sperm cell, 'mother' cells of the reproductive system divided in a way that was different from cell division in the rest of the body. It was this difference that was the key. Known as the process of meiosis, here the chromosomes divided and half of the chromosomal material went into each of the resulting 'daughter' cells. In all the other body cells, the 'daughter' cell has the same amount of the chromosome material as the ‘mother’(If you're confused, remember that a 'mother' cell is just any existing cell and that it splits into two 'daughter' cells. They are found throughout the body and have nothing to do with real mothers and daughters.) So when the egg and sperm cells fused, the two halves of the chromosomal material would make up the full amount again in the fertilized egg. These reproductive cells were different to all the other cells of the body. Weissman argued that it did not matter what else happened to the cells of the muscles or bones or blood vessels or nerves: only these reproductive cells contained what would be inherited by the individual's offspring. So in the case of the giraffe's neck the supposed stretching would have no effect on the egg and sperm cells, and it was these cells that contained what he termed the ‘germ plasm’. It was the germ plasm, on the chromosomes of the egg and sperm cells, which was inherited, and he called his idea of heredity the ‘continuity of the germ plasm’.

Mendel的豌豆实验之前几年，Rudolf Virchow宣布了他的细胞分裂的思想（见第26章）。在1880年和1890年Weismann发现，母细胞在产生精子细胞或卵子细胞时，其复制机制与机体其他部分的细胞分裂时的机制不一样，这种区别非常关键。这里染色体分裂，其中一半染色体物质进入形成的子代细胞中，这种分裂方式叫减数分裂。在其他体细胞分裂时，子代细胞中含有的染色体物质与母细胞中是一样的（如果你觉得糊涂，记住母细胞是任何存在的细胞，其分裂为2个子细胞，在机体中到处都是，这和真的母亲女儿没有任何关系）。所以在精子和卵子结合的时候，这两半染色体物质会在受精卵中形成完整的染色体。这些生殖细胞和其他体细胞是不一样的。Weismann辩论到，肌肉细胞、骨细胞、血管细胞或者神经细胞发生了什么都不重要，只有生殖细胞包含能被后代个体遗传的信息。所以在长颈鹿的脖子这种例子中，脖子的拉伸对精子细胞核卵细胞没有任何影响，是因为这些细胞中包含“生殖细胞的细胞质”（germ plasm）。是精子细胞和卵细胞中的染色体上的生殖细胞细胞质，携带了遗传信息，他将这种遗传的想法叫“生殖细胞细胞质的连续性”。

In 1900 not one but three separate scientists dusted off copies of the journal with Mendel's article in it. They alerted the scientific world to the results of Mendel's pea experiments. Biologists realized that Mendel had provided the best experimental evidence yet for Weismann's ‘continuity of the germ plasm’ and that ‘Mendelism’, as it was soon called, had a sound scientific basis.

1900年，三位科学家翻出了Mendel的文章。他们以Mendel的豌豆实验的结果警告科学界。生物学家意识到Mendel为Weismann的“生殖细胞细胞质连续性”提供了最好的实验证据，随后被叫做“Mendelism”，这有着坚实的科学基础。

The scientific community was soon split into two groups, the ‘Mendelians’ and the ‘biometricians’. The biometricians, led by the statistics expert Karl Pearson (1857 -1936), believed in 'continuous' inheritance. They thought that what we inherit is an average of the attributes of our parents. They conducted important fieldwork in measuring very small differences in sea creatures and snails. They showed that such small differences could play a significant role in determining how many offspring survived - what is termed the reproductive success of species. The Mendelians were led by the Cambridge biologist William Bateson(1861-1926). He coined the term ‘genetics’. Mendelians emphasized the inheritance of the sort of discrete (separate) traits that the monk had illustrated. They argued that biological change occurred by leaps, rather than the slow, continuous changes of the biometricians. Both groups accepted the fact of evolution: they merely argued about how it happened.

科学界很快分成两个群体，孟德尔派和生物统计学派。生物统计学派的领导人是统计学专家Karl Pearson（1857-1936），他们相信渐进的遗传，认为我们遗传的父辈平均特征信息。他们对海洋生物和蜗牛类的腹足类动物做了很多重要现场工作，测量了它们之间微小的差别。他们说明了这些微小的差别可以在决定有多少后代存活方面起重要作用，并有个专有名词，物种繁殖成功率。孟德尔派由剑桥生物学家William Bateson（1861-1926）领导。他创造了“遗传学”这个名词。孟德尔派强调了神父描述的遗传不连续特征，他们辩论说发生的生物变化是突变的，而不是生物统计学派的缓慢连续变化。两派都承认进化的事实，但就进化是如何发生的意见不一。

These arguments were fierce for about twenty years. Then, in the 1920s, several people showed that each group was right and wrong at the same time. They were just looking at two different sides of the same problem. Many biological characteristics are inherited in a ‘blending’, ‘biometrical’ fashion. A tall father and a short mother will have offspring that average out or 'blend' their heights. Some of the children may be as tall as the father (or even taller), but the average height will tend to be midway between the two parents. Other characteristics, such as human eye color, or the color of peas, are inherited in an either/or, not a both/and fashion. The differences between the Mendelians and the biometricians were resolved when they measured whole populations, and then applied mathematical reasoning to the problem. These new biologists, such as J.B.S. Haldane (1892-1964), appreciated the brilliance of Darwin's original insights. They realized that in any population there is random variation that can be inherited. If it gives an advantage, those plants and animals that have it will survive and other kinds of variation will die out.

他们就此激烈争论了约20年。到了20世纪20年代，几个人证实了每个派别都是对的和错的，他们只是看到了同一个问题的不同侧面。很多生物特征是以一种混合的生物统计学的方式遗传的。一个高的父辈和矮的母辈的后代会将他们的身高折中，有的后代可能会和父辈一样高（或者更高），但后代们的平均身高就是在父母辈身高之间。其他特征，如眼睛的颜色，豌豆的颜色，则以一种“不是/就是”的方式遗传，而不是“都有/和”的方式。通过测量整个种群的身高并对问题进行数学推理，解决了孟德尔派和生物统计学派的分歧。这些新的生物学家，如J.B.S. Haldane（1892-1964），对达尔文原创性的深刻见解非常折服，他们认识到在任何种群中都有遗传的随机变化。给出一种优势基因，那么含有这种基因的动物或植物会存活的更多，而其他的变异则会慢慢消失。

How we inherit what we do is also vitally important too. This was the next part of the puzzle. Much of the early work was carried out in the laboratory of Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866-1945), at Columbia University in New York City. He began his career looking at how animals begin life and develop as embryos. He never completely lost his interest in embryology, but his attention shifted in the early 1900s to the new science of genetics. Morgan's lab was no ordinary place. Nicknamed the 'Fly Room', it became home to thousands of generations of the common fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The fruit fly is a convenient experimental animal. These flies have only four chromosomes in the nuclei of their cells, and it was the role of the chromosomes that Morgan wanted to understand: how important were chromosomes in passing on hereditary traits? The fruit fly chromosomes are large and easy to see on microscopic slides. Fruit flies also breed very quickly - leave out a plate of fruit and watch what happens. Many generations can be studied in a short space of time, to see what happens when flies with certain characteristics are bred with other flies. Imagine doing this kind of work with elephants and you can see why they chose fruit flies.

我们怎样进行遗传也是非常重要的。这是问题的下一部分。早期的工作很多是在Thomas Hunt Morgan（1866-1945）的实验室中完成的，他的实验室在纽约哥伦比亚大学。他最初的工作是研究动物怎样开始新生命，慢慢的发育成胚胎。他一直也没有丢掉胚胎学，但在20世纪初转到了新的遗传学上。Morgan的实验室不是个普通的地方，昵称是“果蝇屋”，是数千代普通果蝇的家。果蝇是一种方便的实验动物，它们的细胞核中只有4条染色体。Morgan想理解染色体的作用：染色体在遗传特征的传递上到底有多大的作用？果蝇的染色体较大，在显微镜中非常容易观察。果蝇的繁殖也很快，只需要一盘水果，然后就可以观察发生的事了。很短的时间内就可以研究很多代果蝇，研究当有特定特征的果蝇和其他果蝇一起繁殖时会发生什么。只要想想要是用大象做实验，就会知道为什么他们选择果蝇做实验对象。

Morgan's fly room became famous, attracting both students and other scientists. It was a forerunner of the way much science is done today: a group of researchers working under a 'boss' - Morgan - who helps define the problems. The boss supervises the work of his or her team of younger researchers, who do the actual experiments. Morgan encouraged everyone to talk and work together so it has been hard to sort out exactly who did what. (When Morgan won his Nobel Prize, he shared the money with two of his younger colleagues.)

Morgan的果蝇屋名气慢慢大起来，吸引了很多学生和其他科学家。他是现代科学运行方式的先驱者：一群研究者在一个老板下开展工作，这个老板就是Morgan，他提出要解决的问题。老板监督他的团队，年轻的研究人员进行实际实验。Morgan鼓励每个人一起聊天，一起工作，所以很难分出到底是谁做了什么（当Morgan获得了诺贝尔奖时，他将奖金与两位年轻同事进行了分享）。

Almost by chance, Morgan made a crucial discovery. He noticed that one fly from a recent hatching had red eyes, rather than the usual white ones. He isolated this fly before breeding it with ordinary white-eyed flies. When he looked at the red-eyed offspring of that fly, he discovered first that all his red-eyed flies were female. That suggested that the gene was carried on the sex chromosome, the chromosome that determines whether the offspring will be male or female. Second, the inheritance patterns of eye color followed the same rules as Mendel's peas - the eyes were either white or red, but never pink, or some color in between. Morgan looked at other patterns of the tiny flies' inherited traits, such as wing size and shape. He and his colleagues examined their chromosomes under the microscope and began to develop maps of each chromosome, showing where the units of heredity (the ‘genes’, as they had been called) were located. Mutations (changes), such as the sudden appearance of the red eyes, could help locate where the gene was, as they carefully analyzed what the chromosomes did during cell division. One of Morgan's students, H.J.Muller (1890-1967), discovered that X-rays caused faster mutations. Muller won his own Nobel Prize in 1948, and his work alerted the world to the dangers of radiation from atomic bombs and even from the X-rays being used medically. Morgan also showed that chromosomes sometimes exchange material when they are dividing. This is called ‘crossing over’, and it is another way in which nature increases the amount of variation in plants and animals.

Morgan几乎是凭借运气得到了关键的发现。他注意到新孵化出的一只果蝇有红色的眼睛，而不是普通的白色眼睛。他将其隔离了起来，然后将其与其他白色眼睛果蝇一起繁殖。当他观察这只红色眼睛果蝇的后代时，他首先发现这些红色眼睛果蝇都是雌性的。这说明这种基因在性染色体中携带，也就是决定是后代是雄性还是雌性的染色体。然后，眼睛颜色的遗传模式和Mendel豌豆实验的遗传模式是一样的，即眼睛不是白色就是红色，而没有像粉红或中间这种颜色的。Morgan观察了果蝇的其他遗传特征如翅膀尺寸和形状，的遗传模式。他和同事开始在显微镜下研究染色体，然后开始绘制染色体图，说明遗传单位（他们称之为基因）的分布。当他们仔细分析细胞分裂时染色体的行为时，变异（变化），比如突然出现的红色眼睛，会帮助定位基因位置。Morgan的一个学生，H.J. Muller(1890-1967)，发现X射线会使变异加速。Muller在1948年获得了自己的诺贝尔奖，他的工作警告这个世界原子弹甚至医用X射线的辐射的危险性。Morgan同时发现染色体在分裂时候有时候会交换物质，这被称为“杂交”，这是自然界中的动物和植物增加变异几率的另一种方式。

Morgan and his group, as well as many others around the world, made genetics one of the most exciting sciences between about 1910 and 1940. The 'gene' was increasingly recognized as some material substance. Located on the chromosomes of the cells, the genes are passed, via a female egg fertilized by a male sperm, to the offspring, each parent contributing equally. Mutations were shown to be the thing that drove evolutionary change. They created the variation and they occurred naturally as well as by the artificial methods that Muller studied.

Morgan和他的小组，以及世界上其他很多人，使遗传学在1910年到1940年成为最令人兴奋的学科之一。越来越多的人承认“基因”是某种实物材料。基因位于细胞中的染色体上，由精子使卵子受精，进而遗传给后代，雄性和雌性的贡献率是相同的。变异是证明是驱动进化变化的动力。它们产生变化，这通过自然的方式或者像Muller研究的人工方式发生。

The new genetics was central to evolutionary thinking. Even though what exactly the 'gene' was remained undefined, its reality was now beyond doubt. This new genetic thinking had a darker side in society. If there was no soft heredity - so that eating better food, playing sports or being good, could not change the genes of your children – different methods would have to be used if you wanted future generations to improve. Darwin's 'artificial selection' had been practiced for centuries, by livestock and plant breeders who tried to improve on the desirable characteristics of whatever they were breeding. Cows could be bred to yield more milk, tomatoes to be even juicier. In 1904, Francis Galton (Darwin's cousin) founded a 'eugenics' laboratory. He had coined the term 'eugenics', meaning 'good birth'. Here he had tried to change the reproductive habits of human beings. If intelligence, creativity, criminality, insanity or laziness could be shown to run in families (and Galton believed they could), it made sense to encourage the 'good' to have more children ('positive' eugenics), and to prevent the 'bad' from having so many ('negative' eugenics). Positive eugenics was the most common form in Britain. Campaigns encouraged educated middle-class couples to have more children, on the assumption that these couples were somehow 'better' than a casual laborer and his wife. In the late 1890s, the government had been frightened by the poor condition of recruits for the Boer War in South Africa. A large number of volunteers were rejected as physically unfit, unable even to carry a rifle. Then the First World War, from 1914 to 1918, saw mass slaughter in the battlefields of Europe. Many assumed that it was mostly the best who had been lost. Every nation throughout the Western world worried about the quality and strength of its population.

新的遗传学是进化的中心思想。虽然“基因”到底是什么尚未确切定义，它的真实存在是毫无疑问的。这种新的遗传思维对于社会来说有着不好的影响。如果没有软遗传，那么吃更好的食物、运动或者做个好人，并不能改变孩子的基因，如果你想让改善后代的话，那么就必须要使用其他什么手段。达尔文的“人工选择”理论应用了几个世纪，让牲畜饲养员和植物培育者来改进某些特征。奶牛可以产更多的奶，西红柿更加多汁。1904年，Francis Galton（达尔文的表弟）成立了一个优生学实验室。他创造了优生学这个词，意思是“优良生育”，这里他尝试改变人类的生育习惯。如果智力、创造力、犯罪行为、精神病或懒惰能以家庭为单位进行（Galton认为可以），那么就可以很自然的鼓励“好”的家庭生育更多的孩子（积极优生学），防止“坏”的家庭生育更多孩子（消极优生学）。积极优生学在英国最为普遍，不断的宣传鼓励了受教育的中产阶级夫妇生更多的孩子，这是基于这些夫妇比临时工夫妇要“更好”的假设上进行的。在19世纪90年代，政府为南非的布尔真正征召了很多人，政府对这些人恶劣的条件所受惊，很多志愿者因为身体不合格甚至不能拿起步枪被拒绝。接着在第一次世界大战的1914到1918年，发生了欧洲战场的大规模屠杀。很多人认为失去的主要都是那些最优秀的人。所有西方国家都很担心其国民的质量和力量。

Negative eugenics was more sinister. Many assumed it was sensible to lock away people who were mentally disturbed or ‘subnormal’, criminals, even disabled people and others at the margins of society. In the USA, many states passed laws enforcing sterilization, to prevent these people from having children. From the 1930s until their defeat in the Second World War in 1945, the Nazis in Germany practiced the worst atrocities. In the name of the State, they first incarcerated, and then murdered millions of people they decided were unfit to live. Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally disturbed or deficient, criminals: all were herded up and either sent to concentration camps or executed.

消极优生学更多的是灾难罪恶，很多人假设将心理不正常的人、低能的人、罪犯、甚至残疾人和其他社会边缘人关起来是正常的。在美国，很多州通过了法律，强制绝育使这些人不生孩子。从20世纪30年代，直到1945年战败，德国纳粹的暴行最为恶劣。他们以国家的名义，一开始监禁，后来屠杀了数百万他们认为不适合生存的人，犹太人，吉普赛人，同性恋者，精神病患者，残疾人，罪犯：全被聚在一起，要么送到集中营，要么处死。

The Nazi period made 'eugenics' a dirty word. As we shall later see, some people believe that eugenics could return through the back door, as scientists learn more and more about what we inherit, and how it affects who we are. We all need science, but we must all make sure that it is used for good.

纳粹时代将优生学变成了一个肮脏的单词。我们将会看到，随着科学对遗传研究的越来越深入，我们慢慢的知道遗传怎样影响我们，有些人相信优生学将会以另一种方式回归。我们都需要科学，但我们必须确保科学用在好的地方。

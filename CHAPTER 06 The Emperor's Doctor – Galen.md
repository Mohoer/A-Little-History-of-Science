# CHAPTER 6 The Emperor’s Doctor – Galen
# 第6章 皇帝的医生 – 盖伦

Galen(129-c. 210) was very clever and was not afraid to say so. He scribbled constantly, and his writings are full of his own opinions and accomplishments. More of his words survive than those of any other author from ancient times, which proves that people valued Galen’s works very highly. There are twenty fat volumes that you can read, and he actually wrote many more. So we know more about Galen than we do about most other ancient thinkers. It doesn’t hurt that Galen also adored writing about himself.

盖伦(129-c.210)是非常聪明的，盖伦也不怕这么说。他经常写一些东西，他的作品里都是他自己的意见和成就。他流传下来的作品比其他古代作家都多，这也说明了人们非常珍惜盖伦的工作。有20大卷的内容可以阅读，实际上他写了更多。所以我们对盖伦的了解比对其他古代思想家的了解都要多。即使知道盖伦喜欢描写自己，也不会影响对他的印象。

Galen was born in Pergamum, now part of Turkey but then on the fringes of the Roman Empire. His father was a prosperous architect who was devoted to his gifted son, providing him with a sound education (in Greek) which included philosophy and mathematics. Who knows what might have happened had his father not had a powerful dream, telling him that his son ought to become a doctor? Galen changed his studies to medicine. After his father 's death left him well-off, he spent several years traveling and learning, spending time at the famous library and museum in Alexandria in Egypt.

盖伦生于Pergamum，现在是土耳其的一部分，他那个时代是罗马帝国的边缘。他的父亲是一个富有的设计师，同时也非常关心他的儿子，在希腊给了他健全的教育，包括哲学教育和数学教育。如果他的父亲没有强大的梦想，告诉他的儿子应当成为一个医生，那谁知道会发生什么呢？盖伦将医学转为他的研究方向。在他父亲去世后，他还是很富裕的，他花了几年时间旅行、学习，在埃及亚历山大著名的图书博物馆待了很长时间。

Back in Pergamum, Galen became a doctor to the gladiators - the men chosen to entertain well-to-do citizens by fighting each other, or by facing lions and other beasts in the arena. Taking care of them was an important job, since the poor men needed to be patched up between the shows so they could keep on fighting. By his own account, Galen was extremely successful. He would have had dramatic experience in the surgical treatment of wounds. He also acquired a considerable reputation among the rich and, around AD 160, he took himself to Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire. He began writing on anatomy (the study of the bodily structures of humans and animals) and physiology (the study of what those structures do). He also went on a military campaign with the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. The emperor was the author of a famous series of Meditations and the two men discussed philosophy during the long campaign. Marcus Aurelius appreciated Galen, and Galen profited from the emperor's support. A steady stream of important patients were sent his way whom, if Galen's reports are to be believed, he always cured if they could be.

回到了Pergamum后，盖伦成为了角斗士的医生，角斗士被选来娱乐希腊的富裕市民，或者通过在竞技场中互相打斗，或者与狮子或其他野兽搏斗。照顾他们是非常重要的工作，因为演出间隙需要为那些可怜的人缝合伤口，这样他们可以继续打斗。据他自己说，盖伦是非常成功的。他肯定在处理外伤手术的过程中得到了相当多的经验。他在富人中也赢得了极好的名声，在公元160年左右，他去了罗马帝国的首都罗马城。他开始写作有关解剖学（动物和人的身体结构的研究）和生理学（这些结构的工作机理的研究）的内容。他还跟着皇帝Marcus Aurelius去了战场进行了战役。皇帝是一系列著名的沉思录的作者，在漫长的战役中，两个人讨论了哲学。Marcus Aurelius很欣赏盖伦，盖伦从皇帝的支持中受益。源源不断的病人送到他这里，而且如果盖伦的报告可信的话，他总是能治好那些有希望的人。

Galen's medical hero was Hippocrates, even though he had been dead for more than 500 years. Galen saw himself as completing and extending the master's legacy, and, in many ways, this is exactly what he did. He produced commentaries on many of the Hippocratic works, and assumed that the works that agreed most closely with his own views were by Hippocrates himself. His comments on Hippocrates are still valuable, not least because Galen was an expert linguist with a good eye for the changing meanings of words. Most importantly, he put the Hippocratic doctrine of the humours in the form that was used for more than a thousand years. Imagine being that influential!

盖伦在医学上的偶像是希波克拉底，即使他已经去世了500年。盖伦视自己补全并延伸了大师的遗产，而且在很多年里，他确实是这么做的。他给很多希波克拉底的著作写下注释，并注明了很多与自己观点接近的著作是希波克拉底的。他的注释仍然非常有价值，尤其是因为盖伦是一个语言学专家，很注意词语意义的变化。最重要的是，他将希波克拉底学派的体液理论继续沿用了1000多年。想象一下这个影响力！

The idea of the balance and imbalance of the humours was central to Galen's medical practice. Like Hippocrates, he believed that the four humours - blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm - were, in special ways, hot or cold, and moist or dry. To treat a malady, you chose an 'opposite' remedy, but also one of the same intensity. So diseases that were hot and moist in the third degree, for example, would be treated with a remedy that was cold and dry in the third degree. For example, if the patient had a runny nose and felt chilled, drying, warming medicines and food would be used. By rebalancing the humours, you could restore a healthy 'neutral' state. This was all very logical and simple, but in reality things were more complicated. Doctors still needed to know a great deal about their patients, and administer their remedies with care. Galen was always quick to point out when other doctors got it wrong (which was often) so that everyone knew his diagnoses and therapies were better. He was a shrewd doctor, much in demand, who paid great attention to the mental as well as physical aspects of health and disease. He once diagnosed a case of ‘love-sickness’, where a young lady became weak and nervous whenever a handsome male dancer was performing in town.

体液平衡与不平衡的观点是盖伦医学实践的中心。和希波克拉底学派一样，他认为四种体液 – 血液，黄胆汁，黑胆汁和黏液 – 是具有或热或冷，或湿或干的属性的。为了治疗一种疾病，你选择“相反”的治疗方法，但也要具有相同强度的。所以，举例来说，热而湿的处于第三层次的疾病，需要用冷而干的第三层次的治疗。比如，如果病人流鼻涕、感觉很冷，就需要用干的、暖的药和食物。通过体液的再平衡，你可以恢复中性状态。这都是很符合逻辑的，而且很简单，但实际中情况通常更复杂。医生还是要知道病人的非常多情况，小心的给予治疗。盖伦经常很快就能指出其他医生错误的地方（这是很经常的），这样所有人就都知道了他的诊断和疗法是更好的。他是一个精明的医生，非常受欢迎，花了很大精力在精神疾病和身体疾病这两方面。他有一次诊断了一种“相思病”，一位年轻女士每当有很帅的男舞者在镇上表演的时候，都会变得又虚弱又紧张。

Galen came up with the practice of feeling his patient's pulse - something that doctors still do. He wrote a treatise on how the pulse - slow or fast, strong or faint, regular or irregular – could be useful in diagnosing disease, even though he had no idea about the circulation of the blood.

盖伦想到可以试试病人的脉搏，现在的医生也时常这样做。他写了一篇专著，论述脉搏（或慢或快，或强或弱，或规则或不规则）可以在诊断病情时非常有用，即使那个时候他还不知道血液循环。

Galen was more interested in anatomy than the Hippocratics. He opened up the bodies of dead animals and examined human skeletons wherever he could. Dissecting human bodies was frowned upon in ancient societies, so Galen could not do that, although we think that a few earlier doctors might have been allowed to examine the bodies of condemned criminals while they were still alive. Galen learned about human anatomy from dissections of animals, like pigs and monkeys, and by lucky chances – the discovery of a decaying dead body, or bad injuries that showed the structure of skin, muscle and bone. Scientists still use animals in their research, but they must be careful to be clear about where they got their information. Galen often forgot to mention where he had got his facts from, so it could be confusing.

盖伦比希波克拉底更对解剖感兴趣。只要有可能，他剖开死亡动物的身体并检查，也包括人的骨骼。古代社会是不赞成解剖人类尸体的，所以盖伦不能那样做，虽然我们认为一些更早期的医生可能允许检查定罪犯人的身体（当他们还活着的时候）。盖伦从解剖动物，比如猪和猴子来学习人体的解剖，有时候运气好，会遇到腐烂的尸体，或者严重的外伤会把皮肤、肌肉和骨头的结构都显露出来。科学家仍然在使用中使用动物，但他们要小心弄清楚他们从哪里得到的信息。盖伦经常忘记提及他从哪里得到的那些事实，这让人觉得困惑。

Anatomy was, for Galen, an important subject in its own right, but it was also fundamental for understanding what the organs of the body actually do. One of his most influential treatises was called On the Uses of the Parts, which looked at the structures of the 'parts', or organs, and what role they played in the working of the whole human body. Galen assumed, as you would do, that each part does do something, otherwise it wouldn't be there. (I doubt if he ever saw the human appendix. That tiny part of our digestive organs probably long, long ago helped us to digest plants, but it doesn't have a function any more.)

解剖学对于盖伦自己来说是非常重要的课题，而且对理解身体各器官都是做什么的也很基础。他最有影响的一篇论文是《论器官的作用》，研究了器官的结构，和在整个人体中起到的作用。盖伦假设每个部分都有其一定的作用，否则就不会存在，你也会这样假设的（我怀疑他可能没看到人的阑尾，我们消化器官的一部分，很久很久以前帮助我们消化植物，但现在却没有什么作用了）。

At the centre of all bodily function was a substance the Greeks called pneuma. 'Pneuma' is not easily translated into English: we'll use 'spirit' but it also has the idea of 'air'; it has given rise to various medical terms in our own times, such as 'pneumonia'. For Galen, the body contained three kinds of pneuma, and understanding what they each did was central to understanding how the body functions. The most basic kind of pneuma was associated with the liver, and was concerned with nutrition. The liver, Galen believed, was able to draw material from the stomach after it had been eaten and digested, turn it into blood and then infuse it with 'natural' spirit. This blood from the liver then coursed through the veins throughout the body, to nourish the muscles and other organs.

人体功能的中心是希腊人称为pneuma的物质。Pneuma不太好翻译，我们可以说是“精神”，但也有“空气”的意思；它还衍生出我们这个时代用的一些医学术语，比如“肺炎”(pneumonia)。对盖伦来说，身体有三种pneuma，理解每种是什么作用对于理解我们身体的作用非常关键。最基本的pneuma是和肝联系在一起的，同时与营养有关。盖伦相信肝脏可以在我们吃饭消化后从胃里汲取物质，转化为血液，然后灌入“自然的”精神。肝脏中的血液沿着血管流过全身，滋养肌肉和其他器官。

Some of this blood passed from the liver through a large vein, the vena cava, into the heart where it was further refined with another spirit, the 'vital' one. The heart and lungs worked together in this process, some of the blood passing through the pulmonary artery (going from the right side of the heart) into the lungs. There it nourished the lungs and also mixed with the air we breathe in through the lungs. Meanwhile, some of the blood in the heart passed from right to left through the middle portion of the heart (the septum). This blood was bright red because, Galen thought, it had the vital spirit infused within it. (Galen recognized that blood in the arteries is a different color from blood in the veins.) From the left side of the heart, blood went out via the aorta, the large artery taking blood from the left chamber, or ventricle, of the heart, in order to warm the body. Despite his appreciation of the importance of blood in the life of an individual, Galen had no sense that the blood circulates, as William Harvey was to discover almost 1,500 years later.

一部分这些血液从肝脏经过一个大的血管，腔静脉，进入心脏，在这里进一步提炼为另一种精神，“充满活力的”精神。心脏和肺在这个过程中一起工作，有些血液流经肺动脉（从心脏右部流过）进入肺部。在那里滋养了肺之后，溶入呼吸进来的空气。同时，一些心脏里的血液从右往左流经心脏中部（膈膜）。这些血液是明亮的红色，盖伦认为是由于充满活力的精神已经注入其中（盖伦注意到了动脉中血液的颜色与静脉中血液的颜色不同）。从心脏左侧，血液流经主动脉，大动脉从左心室供血，温暖了整个身体。虽然很重视血液在人体生命中的作用，盖伦并不知道血液是循环的，这要在1500年后由William Harvey发现。

In Galen's scheme, some of the blood from the heart also went to the brain, where it was mixed with the third kind of pneuma, the 'animal' spirit. This was the most refined kind of spirit. It gave the brain its own special functions as well as flowing out through the nerves, enabling us to move using our muscles and to experience the external world using our senses.

盖伦的计划中，心脏中的部分血液流向大脑，在那里与第三种pneuma，“动物”精神，相混合。这是最精细的精神。这给了大脑最特殊的功能，也让血液流经神经，让我们可以用肌肉运动，用感官感受外部世界。

Galen's three-part system of spirits, each associated with the important organs (liver, heart, brain), was accepted for more than a thousand years. It's worth remembering that Galen used this system primarily to explain how our bodies work when we are healthy. When he tended sick patients, he continued to rely on the system of humours devised by the Hippocratics.

盖伦的精神三分法，每个都与重要的器官（肝脏、心脏、大脑）相关，这被接受并应用了超过一千年。应当记得盖伦用这个体系主要用来解释身体健康时的运作。当他给病人看病时，他还是使用希波克拉底提出的体液理论。

Galen also wrote about most other aspects of medicine, such as drugs and their properties, the diseases of the special organs like the lungs, hygiene, or how to preserve health, and the relationship between our minds and our bodies. His thinking was very sophisticated. In fact he believed that a doctor should be both a philosopher and an investigator: a thinker and an experimenter. He argued that medicine should, above all, be a rational science, and he paid a lot of attention to the best ways to gain good, reliable knowledge. Later doctors, who also saw themselves as learned men of science, liked Galen's mix of practical advice (based on his vast experience) and broad thinking. No single Western doctor in all history has exerted such an influence for so long.

盖伦在医学的其他方面也有著作，比如药物及其性质，特殊习惯比如肺的疾病，卫生学，怎样保健，心理和身体的关系。他的思想很复杂。实际上他认为医生应当既是哲学家，也是调查家：思考者和实验者。他认为医学首先要成为理性的科学，还花费了大量精力寻找得到好的可靠知识的最好方法。后世的医生也认为自己是科学上博学的人，他们都喜欢盖伦广博思维和实践建议（基于他大量的经验）。所有历史上，没有哪个西方医生有这么久的影响。

There are several reasons for Galen's long shadow. First, he had a very high opinion of Aristotle, so that the two were often spoken about together. Like Aristotle, Galen was a deep thinker and an energetic investigator of the world. Both believed this world had been designed, and praised the Designer. Galen was not a Christian, but he believed in a single God, and it was easy for early Christian commentators to include him in the Christian fold. His confidence meant that he had an answer for everything. Like most people who write many books over a long period, he was not always consistent, but he was always definite in his opinions. He was commonly referred to later as 'the divine Galen', a label of which he would have been proud.

盖伦的影响这么大有几个原因。第一，他很推崇亚里士多德，所以他们两个经常一起讨论。和亚里士多德一样，盖伦思考深邃，对周围世界调查积极。他们都相信这个世界是设计出来的，并赞美设计者。盖伦不是基督徒，但他相信只有一个上帝，这对于早期基督徒评论人将其纳入基督徒中是很容易的事。他的信心意味着他对所有事物都有回答。就像大多数在很长一段时间写了很多书的人一样，他并不总是持续写的，但他对于他的观点都很明确。后人经常称之为“神圣的盖伦”，他肯定对于这个称号很自豪。

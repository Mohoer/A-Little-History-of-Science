# CHAPTER 39 The Big Bang
# 第39章 宇宙大爆炸

lf a film of the history of the universe had been made, what would happen if you ran it backwards? At about five billion years ago our planet would disappear, for this is when it probably formed, from the debris of our solar system. Keep going back to the beginning and what happened then? The Big Bang: an explosion so powerful that its temperature and force are still being felt some 13.8 billion years later.

如果制作了一部关于宇宙历史的电影，那么如果快退播放会怎么样呢？大约50亿年以前，我们的星球将会消失，因为我们的地球就是在那个时候从太阳系的碎片中形成的。如果继续回退到初始点，会是什么呢？宇宙大爆炸：这个爆炸能量非常强大，13.8亿年后的现在我们仍然能感到这次爆炸的温度和力量。

At least this is what scientists from the 1940s began to suggest with increasing confidence. The universe had begun from a point, an unimaginably hot, dense state, and then there was the big bang. Ever since this moment, it has been cooling and expanding, carrying the galaxies outwards from this original point. Ours is a dynamic and exciting universe, in which we are the tiniest of tiny specks. It is composed of the stars, planets and comets making up the visible galaxies; there is also much that's invisible - black holes and the much more abundant 'dark matter' and 'dark energy'.

40年代后的科学家对这次爆炸的真实性越来越有信心。宇宙最初始于一个点，温度、密度高到不可想象，然后就有了这次爆炸。大爆炸以后，宇宙一直在冷却、膨胀，众多星系从原点膨胀到越来越远。我们的宇宙是一个动态和活跃的宇宙，地球只是其中一个最小的小灰尘。可见宇宙是由恒星、行星和彗星组成的，还有很多是不可见的，包括黑洞，和多的多的暗物质和暗能量。

So, did the Big Bang really happen, and can it explain the universe? Nobody was there of course, to begin filming. And what happened just before the Big Bang? These are questions that it is impossible to answer with any certainty, but they involve a lot of cutting-edge physics, as well as cosmology (the study of the universe). They have generated much debate over the past half-century or so. And it goes on right now.

那么，到底有没有大爆炸呢？它能不能解释我们现在的宇宙呢？当然，没有人去拍有关这个的电影，还有，大爆炸之前发生了什么呢？这些问题都是无法回答的，这些问题都与最尖端的物理科学、宇宙学有关，过去的50年中围绕这些问题有很多争论，而且仍然在争论之中。

Around 1800, the French Newtonian, Laplace, developed his nebular hypothesis (Chapter 18). He was mainly aiming to argue that the solar system had developed from a giant gas cloud. It convinced a lot of people that the earth had an ancient history, which would help explain its characteristics, such as its central heat, fossils and other geological features. Many nineteenth-century scientists passionately disputed the age of the earth and of our galaxy, the Milky Way. In the early decades of the twentieth century, two developments radically altered the questions.

1800年前后，Laplace（一个牛顿物理学家）发展了自己的星云假说（见第18章）。他的假说主要认为，我们的太阳系是从一个巨大的气体云中形成的。这可以解释为什么地球会有非常古老的历史，也对解释地球的特征有帮助，如地核热，化石和其他地质特征。很多19世纪的科学家热切的争论我们的地球和星系，即银河系的年龄。20世纪最初几十年，有两个发展从根本上改变了这些问题。

The first was Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, with its important implications for time and space (Chapter 32). By insisting that these two things are intimately related, as ‘space-time’, Einstein added a new dimension to the universe. Einstein's mathematical work also implied that space was curved, so that Euclid's geometry didn't quite provide an adequate explanation over the vast distances of space. In Euclid's universe, parallel lines go on for ever, and never touch. But this assumes that space is flat. In a flat, Euclidian world, the sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. But if you are measuring a triangle on a globe, with its curved surface, this doesn't work. And if space itself is curved, we need different forms of mathematics to deal with it.

第一个是爱因斯坦的广义相对论，以及有关时间空间的重要含义（见第32章）。他认为这两个变量是紧密联系的，即“时空”，然后将这一维度加入了对宇宙的描述中。爱因斯坦的数学成果也说明，空间是弯曲的，所以欧几里得几何学在空间尺度巨大的时候就不适用了。在欧几里得宇宙中，平行线永远不会相交，但这是在空间是平坦的假设下。在平坦的欧几里得世界里，三角形内角和永远是180度。但如果你在一个球形上测量三角形内角和，由于表面是弯曲的，就不会得出180度的结论。所以如果空间本身是弯曲的，我们需要另外一种数学来处理其中的问题。

Having accepted the essential truth of Einstein's brilliant work, the physicists and cosmologists had some new thinking to do. While the revolution he brought about was largely a theoretical one, the second major development in cosmology was not theoretical. It was based firmly on observations, especially those of the American astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889-1953). Hubble was celebrated in 1990 when a space shuttle carried into orbit round the earth a space telescope named after him. The Hubble Space Telescope has recently revealed more than even he could have seen with the telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California, where he worked. In the 1920s, Hubble saw further than any astronomer had ever done. He showed that our galaxy (the Milky Way) is not even the beginning of the end of the universe. It is one of countless thousands of other galaxies, stretching even farther than our telescopes can reach.

接受了爱因斯坦的基本结论后，物理学家和宇宙学家很快产生了很多新想法。爱因斯坦提出的革命只是理论上的，第二个宇宙学上的发展则不是理论的，它建立在很多天文学家尤其是Edwin Hubble(1889-1953)坚实的观测基础上。1990年，一架航天飞机将一个以他命名的太空望远镜运到地球轨道。哈勃太空望远镜所能观测到的内容比他之前在California州Wilson山观测站工作时多了很多。在20年代，哈勃得到的观测结果比其他天文学家都要多。他展示了我们的银河系在整个宇宙中的渺小，它只是无数个其他星系其中的一个，我们的望远镜根本看不到宇宙的尽头。

Cosmologists also remember Hubble for the special number, the ‘constant’, attached to his name. (You may remember Planck's constant, which was a similar idea.) When light is moving away from us, it shifts the spectrum of its waves to the red end of the visible spectrum. This is called the 'red shift: If it is moving towards us, its waves shift towards the other end of the spectrum, the 'blue shift: This is an effect that astronomers can easily measure, and is caused by the same thing that makes trains sound different when they are coming towards you and going away from you. What Hubble saw is that light from very distant stars has red shifts, and the further away the star is, the larger the shift. This told him that the stars are moving away from us, and the further away they are, the faster they are moving. The universe is expanding, and it appears to be doing so at an increasing rate. Hubble measured the distance from the stars and the extent of the red shift. His measurements fell on a pretty straight line when he plotted them on a graph. From this he calculated 'Hubble's constant', which he published in a very important paper in 1929. This extraordinary number gave cosmologists a method of calculating the age of the universe.

宇宙学家还因为哈勃常数而纪念他（你可能记得普朗克常数，这也是类似的想法）。当光离开我们时，它的波谱将朝可见光光谱中的红色那端移动，这就是红移。如果光正朝我们运动，它的波谱就会朝另一端移动，即蓝移。这是天文学家很简单就可以观测到的现象，也是火车开向我们和从我们这开走的时候，声音不同的原因。哈勃观测到，距离远的恒星发出的光都有红移，而且距离越远，红移越大。这说明恒星正在离我们远去，距离越远，速度越快。宇宙正在膨胀，而且膨胀速度越来越快。哈勃测量了恒星距离和红移的程度，这些测量点在图上构成了一条直线，根据这些结果，1929年哈勃发表了一篇重要文章，提出了哈勃常数的概念。这个常数使得宇宙学家可以据此计算宇宙的年龄。

Hubble's constant has been refined since then. New observations have found stars even farther away, and we can now make more accurate measurements of the red shift. Some of these stars are millions of light years away. A light year is about six trillion earth miles. It takes only eight minutes for a ray of sunlight to reach the earth. If the ray of light then bounced back to the sun, it could make over 32,000 return journeys in a year - another way of trying to appreciate the vast distances involved. And vast amounts of time. Some of what we see in the night sky is light that began its journey a very long time ago from stars that have since become extinct. To get a really precise value for Hubble's constant, we need to know exactly how far away these very distant stars and galaxies are from us. But even with these difficulties, the constant's importance is that it can tell us approximately how long they have been traveling. This gives the age of the universe - beginning with its Big Bang.

随着发现更远的恒星，红移观测结果精确性的改进，哈勃常数一直在修正。有些恒星远在几百万光年以外。一光年大约是6万亿英里，太阳光到达地球大约需要8分钟，如果阳光反射回太阳，那么一光年的距离大约是来回反射32000多次。这可以让人理解一下宇宙学所涉及到的巨大的空间和时间度量。夜空中我们看到的星光，是很久很久以前发出的，可能那个恒星都已经毁灭了。为了得到哈勃常数的精确值，我们需要精确的知道这些远处的恒星和星系的距离的精确值。尽管有诸多难处，哈勃常数的重要性在于，它可以告诉我们这些光大约传播了多远才到达我们这里。这也就是从大爆炸开始的宇宙的年龄。

The Big Bang was popularized in the 1940s by George Gamow(1904-68). Gamow was a colorful Russian-born physicist who went to America in the early 1930s. He had a wonderfully creative mind, contributing ideas to molecular biology as well as physics and relativity theory. With a colleague, he explored, at the micro-level, how the nucleus of an atom emits electrons (beta particles). On the grand scale, he looked at how nebulae - massive clouds of hot particles and cosmic dust - are formed. His theory of the Big Bang, worked out from 1948 with others, built on knowledge of the smallest constituents of atoms, combined with a model of what might have happened when the universe began.

宇宙大爆炸的概念由George Gamow(1904-1968)在40年代普及开来。Gamow出生在俄国，30年代初到美国。他有很多有创意的想法，在包括分子生物学、物理学、相对论中都有很多贡献。和一个同事一起，他在微观层面探索了原子核如何放射出电子（beta射线）。在宏观层面，他探索了星云（大量热粒子和宇宙灰尘的合集）是如何形成的。由最小的原子的构成，结合宇宙最初形成时的情形，他和同事们1948年提出了宇宙大爆炸理论。

First, the constituents: the particles and forces. In the late 1940s this bit of physics came to be called quantum electrodynamics or QED for short. One man who helped make sense of it was the American physicist Richard Feynman (1918-88). He is famous for the diagrams he drew (sometimes on restaurant napkins) to explain his theories and his mathematics, and for playing the bongo drums. He won the Nobel Prize in 1965, primarily for his work on QED, which provided the complicated mathematics to describe the even smaller particles and forces that we examine below.

首先，组成成分：粒子和原力。40年代后期，物理学发展到了量子电动力学，简称QED，主要应归功于美国物理学家Richard Feynman(1918-1988)。他有时候在餐厅餐巾纸上画图来解释他的理论和数学，他还会打小手鼓。因为QED提供一种用来描述微观粒子和作用力的复杂数学公式，1965年他获得了诺贝尔奖，下面我们就来看看这种描述。

After the end of the Second World War, particle physicists continued to accelerate atoms and then particles in increasingly more powerful particle accelerators. The accelerators can break up atoms into their sub-atomic particles, which is like reversing what might have happened a few instants after the Big Bang. Immediately after the Big Bang, as cooling began, the building-blocks of matter would have begun to form. From the particles would come the atoms and from the atoms the elements, and so on up to the planets and stars.

二战后，粒子物理学家继续建造更强大的粒子加速器，用来加速原子和粒子。加速器可以轰击开原子，打入其中的亚原子粒子，这很像宇宙大爆炸最初几个瞬间的倒映。大爆炸过后，立刻冷却就开始了，物质组成的基础部分开始形成。从粒子组成原子，原子组成元素，然后继续直到形成行星和恒星。

As Einstein's E =mc2 tells us, at ever-higher speeds- almost the speed of light - in the accelerators, the mass is mostly converted into energy. The physicists found that these very fast particles do some fascinating things. The electron emerges unchanged from the accelerator. It is part of a family of force-particles – the leptons. The proton and neutron turn out to be composed of even smaller particles called quarks. There are several kinds. Each comes with a charge. Combined into threes, they make up a neutron or a proton.

爱因斯坦的E=mc2的公式告诉我们，粒子在加速器以接近光速的进行运动时，物质主要转化成能量。物理学家们还发现了高速运动的粒子的其他有趣行为。电子在加速器中不会受到影响。这是原力粒子家族中的一种 – 轻子。质子和中子是由更小的粒子组成的，称之为夸克，有几种不同的夸克，每种都带有一个电量。三种粒子一起就构成了中子或者质子。

There are four basic forces in the universe. Understanding how they relate to each other has been one of the great quests of the twentieth century. Gravity is the weakest, but acts at an infinite distance. It is still not entirely understood, even though we have been officially puzzling about it since Newton's apple. Electromagnetism is involved in many aspects of nature. It keeps the electrons in their orbits in the atom, and, as light, brings us daily news that the sun is still shining. Also in the atom are the strong and weak nuclear forces. These two bind the particles within the nucleus of the atom.

宇宙中有4种基本的力。20世纪最重要的任务之一就是理解这些力之间有什么相互关系。重力是最弱的，但作用距离几乎无限远。虽然自从牛顿的苹果的时代我们就正式思考这个问题，但至今仍然没有完全理解。自然界中有很多电磁学的现象。电磁力使电子在原子中按轨道运行，阳光的到来让我们知道太阳仍然在发光。原子中还有强力和弱力两种原子核中的力量，这两种力使原子核中的粒子成为一个整体。

Leaving aside gravity, the other forces work by the exchange of special particles - force carriers - called bosons. These include the photon, Einstein's quantum of light, which is the boson for electro-magnetism. Yet, perhaps the most famous boson is the missing one: the Higgs Boson. Particle physicists have been looking it for since the 1960s. This boson is thought to create mass in other particles. Finding it would help explain how particles gained their mass in the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang. At the world's biggest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland, scientists think they caught a glimpse of it on their instruments in 2012. The LHC was constructed between 1998 and 2008 by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). CERN itself was established in 1954. It was a cooperative scientific enterprise among several European countries, a result of the high cost of physics research, and the need for many scientists, technicians and computer staff to perform and interpret these experiments at the extremes of matter and energy.

除去重力，其他几种力都是通过交换特殊粒子来实现的，即原力携带者，即玻色子。电磁力的玻色子，就是光子，爱因斯坦用作度量光的单位。最著名的玻色子可能就是Higgs玻色子。粒子物理学家从1960年就开始寻找这种粒子。这种玻色子在其他粒子中产生物质质量，找到这种玻色子可以帮助解释大爆炸后粒子是怎么获得质量的。2012年，在瑞士日内瓦，世界最大的粒子加速器LHC中，科学家认为他们窥到了这种粒子的一瞥。LHC由CERN在1998、2008年建造。CERN本身建立于1954年。这是欧洲几个国家组成的科学合作机构，组成这个机构是因为物理学研究耗资巨大，并且需要将许多科学家、技术人员、计算机员工来开展极端条件下物质和能量的实验并进行解释。

The Higgs Boson would be an extremely useful (but not the final) part of the puzzle known as the Standard Model, which accounts for everything except gravity. And a confirmed Standard Model would move close to a 'Theory of Everything', possibly via string theory, an approach to analyzing all these forces and particles. String theory is based on the assumption that these fundamental forces of nature can be considered as if they were one-dimensional vibrating strings. It uses very complicated mathematics. This work is still science in the making.

Higgs玻色子会在标准模型中非常有用，标准模型可以解释除重力有关的其他任何事。通过弦理论，一种分析所有这些力和粒子的方法，构成的标准模型基本上可以解释任何事情。弦理论的一个基本假说是，这些基本的自然力都可以认为是一维震动的弦。弦理论用到非常复杂的数学理论，并且仍然在发展中。

A lot of this micro-level particle physics is difficult to associate with the ordinary world we live in. But scientists are finding more and more uses for it in nuclear energy, television, computers, quantum computing and medical screening equipment. Beyond these important uses in our daily lives, there is much to be learned too as the idea of the Big Bang has been fitted into what can be seen and not seen in the far reaches of space.

微观层面的粒子物理与我们正常生活的世界很难联系起来。但科学家通过核能、电视、计算机、量子计算和医学影像设备中将其越来越多的应用起来。除了这些重要的日常应用，随着宇宙大爆炸理论在已发现和未发现的空间中得到应用，还有更多的东西需要发现学习。

In the 1920s, the Russian physicist Alexander Friedman (1888-1925) was one of those who quickly assimilated Einstein's general theory of relativity into his own mathematical understanding of the universe. His Friedman Equations provided rules for an expanding universe. Friedman also wondered if it mattered that we looked out at the stars from earth. It's a special place for us, but did this give us a unique place for seeing the universe? He said no, it didn't matter. It's just where we happen to be. Things would not look different if we were on some other planet, light years away. This is Friedman's Cosmological Constant. It gives us another important idea: that matter is uniformly distributed throughout the universe. There are local variations, of course - the earth is much denser than the surrounding atmosphere. But smoothed out across all space, the principle appears to be true. Today, cosmologists still base much of their exploration on Friedman's models. They also have to deal with mysterious things such as black holes and dark matter.

20年代，俄罗斯科学家Alexander Friedman(1888-1925)很快吸收了爱因斯坦的广义相对论，建立了自己有关宇宙的数学理解。他的Friedman方程为这个膨胀的宇宙提供了一条规则。Friedman还怀疑在地球上观测地外恒星的特殊性。地球对于我们来说是个特殊的地方，但对于观测宇宙来说是个独特的地方吗？他说不是，这无所谓，我们只是碰巧在这里。如果我们在几光年外的其他行星上观测，宇宙的样子不会有什么区别。这就是Friedman宇宙常数。它给我们提供了一个重要的观点：宇宙中的物质是均匀分布的。当然，局部会有一些变化，比如地球肯定比周围的空间密度要大的多。但就整个空间的观测而言，这个原则似乎是对的。尽头，宇宙学家仍然将Friedman的模型作为研究探索的基础。他们还需要研究神秘的黑洞和暗物质。

Two fellows of the Royal Society discussed the idea of a 'dark star' in the eighteenth century. Describing its modern equivalent, the ‘black hole’, was the work of a modern mathematical genius, Roger Penrose (b. 1931), and a brilliant theoretical physicist, Stephen Hawking (b. 1942). Until his retirement, Hawking had Isaac Newton's old job as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. Together they explained how black holes are easy to imagine, but of course impossible to see. This is because they are caused by areas in space where dying stars have gradually shrunk. As their remaining matter becomes more densely packed, the forces of gravity become so strong that the photons of light are trapped and cannot get out.

皇家协会的两名人员在18世纪时就讨论过暗物质的概念。现代与之相应的概念就是黑洞，它是一名现代数学天才，Roger Penrose(b. 1931)和一名优秀的理论物理学家，Stephen Hawking(b.1942)的工作成果。Hawking在牛顿的老职位，剑桥大学数学系卢卡斯教授的位置上干到了退休。他们一起解释了怎样简单的想象黑洞的情形，却不可能看到它。这是因为黑洞是由正在死去的恒星逐渐收缩形成的。残余的物质变得非常致密，其重力变得非常大以至于附近的光子都被捕捉在这里而没法出去。

There are also super-massive black holes. In 2008 the Milky Way's very own super black hole - Sagittarius A* - was confirmed after a sixteen-year hunt with telescopes in Chile. Astronomers led by the German Reinhard Genzel (b. 1952) watched the patterns of the stars that orbit the black hole at the centre of the galaxy. They used measurements of infra-red light because there is so much stellar dust between the black hole and us, 27,000 light years away.

也有超大型黑洞。2008年经过智利的望远镜16年的追寻，终于确认了银河系自己的超级黑洞，Sagittarius A*。由于德国天文学家Reinhard Genzel(b.1952)带领的小组观察了恒星围绕星系中心的黑洞转动的模式。由于我们距离黑洞大约27000光年，而且之间隔着大量的星尘，所以他们采用红外光探测。

These super-massive black holes might play a part in the formation of galaxies and involve another part of space we cannot see directly: dark matter. Dark matter is thought to account for much more of the universe - 80 per cent of its matter - than the 4 per cent of the visible stars and planets together with gas and space dust. Dark matter was first considered in the 1930s, to explain why large bits of the universe did not behave exactly as predicted. Scientists had realized there was a mismatch between the mass of the visible parts and their gravitational effects: something was missing. In the 1970s, the astronomer Vera Rubin (b. 1928) charted how fast stars on the edge of galaxies were moving. They were traveling faster than they should have been. Traditionally it was thought that the further they were away from the centre of the galaxy, the slower they would orbit. Dark matter would provide the extra gravity needed to speed up the stars. So indirectly evidence of dark matter was provided and it has been generally accepted. But what dark matter is remains a mystery - something else to be found or disproved in the future.

这些超级黑洞在星系形成的过程中可能起过一定的作用，而且与我们无法观察的暗物质有关。暗物质应当占宇宙80%的质量，相比较下，看得到的恒星、行星与气体、太空尘大约占4%。暗物质大约于30年代第一次被提及，主要为了解释为什么宇宙很多部分没有像预测的那样运动。科学家意识到宇宙现有的可观测部分与重力效应是不匹配的，有什么东西没有被观测到。在70年代，天文学家Vera Rubin(b.1928)就银河系边缘的恒星的运动速度做了图表。它们的运动速度比计算出来的要快。传统上认为，恒星离星系中心越远，其运动速度越慢。暗物质应当提供为恒星加速的额外重力。这就为暗物质提供了存在的间接证据，这种设想也被广泛接受了。但暗物质到底是什么仍然是一个谜，将来可能发现它，也可能证明其不存在。

Modern cosmology has emerged from Einstein's theories, from thousands upon thousands of observations, with computers to analyze the data, and from Gamow's idea of the Big Bang. Like any good theory in science, the Big Bang has changed since Gamow's time. In fact, for two decades after it was put forward in 1948, physicists hardly concerned themselves with the origins of the universe. The Big Bang had to contend with another model of the universe, called the 'steady state' one, most associated with the astronomer Fred Hoyle (1915-2001). Hoyle's model enjoyed some backing in the 1950s. It suggested an infinite universe, with the continuous creation of new matter. In this mode, the universe has no beginning and no end. There were so many difficulties with the steady-state idea that it had only a brief scientific life.

现代宇宙学是从爱因斯坦的理论上发展起来的，建立在数以千计的观测基础上，还有计算机分析其数据，还有Gamow的大爆炸设想。就像科学世界里其他好的理论一样，大爆炸理论自从Gamow提出以来也有所改变。实际上，自从1948年提出后的二十年间，基本没有物理学家关心宇宙起源的问题。大爆炸理论的另一个竞争者是稳态宇宙论，是天文学家Fred Hoyle(1915-2001)提出的。他认为宇宙是无限的，并在持续产生新物质。在这种理论中，宇宙没有起点也没有终点，这种理论还是很难支撑的，其生命力有限。

Physicists now have information about short-lived particles and forces gathered in particle accelerators. They have observations in the far reaches of space. They have been able to refine what we know about the Big Bang. There is still a lot of disagreement about details, and even about some of the fundamental principles, but this is not unusual in science. The Big Bang model can make sense of much that can now be measured, including the red shifts of distant stars, background cosmic radiation and the fundamental atomic forces. It can accommodate black holes and dark matter. What the model does not do, is say why the Big Bang happened. But, then, science deals with the how, not the why. As in all branches of science, some physicists and cosmologists have religious beliefs and others do not. That is how it should be. The best science is done in an atmosphere of tolerance.

物理学家现在有粒子加速器中存活时间很短的粒子及作用力的信息。他们也有远处空间的观测。他们可以改进现有的大爆炸理论。有关细节，甚至基础原理，都有不少不同意见，但这在科学中是常事。大爆炸模型可以解释大多数观测的到的现象，包括远处恒星的红移，宇宙背景辐射，基础原子作用力。它还可以接纳黑洞和暗物质的存在。这个模型没有解决的问题是，为什么大爆炸会发生。但科学本来就是回答怎样，而不是回答为什么的。和所有的科学分支中的人一样，一些物理学家和宇宙学家有宗教信仰，另一些没有。这就是应该的样子。最好的科学都是在宽容的环境中得到的。
